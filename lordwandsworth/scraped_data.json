It is an aspiration and a mind-set that we ask our pupils to stretch themselves two years beyond where they currently are academically in each and every year. At the heart of this lies our own A2RH vision for education, supported by inspirational teaching, teaching which causes our pupils to ask that extra question, to risk linking two concepts together and discover new interrelationships, and above all sees them wanting to share their knowledge with others. The academic curriculum at Lord Wandsworth College is underpinned by the four principles of A2RH: attitudes, approaches, routines and habits. Through these principles we aim to enable all pupils to find and develop a passion for learning that inspires them to improve and that will stay with them beyond their time with us. We were delighted to be shortlisted for our A2RH programme in the Independent Schools of the Year 2022 Awards in the \u2018Innovation Award for an Outstanding New Initiative\u2019 category.",

It makes a considerable difference, and intelligence can change considerably through a person\u2019s lifetime if stimulated appropriately, it is one\u2019s character and application that can really shape one\u2019s destiny. This is an empowering message for children and their families. Character is not inherent; it is born of positive experiences and it can be taught. Character attributes of Fairness, Generosity, Empathy, Loyalty,\u00a0Gratitude, Courage, Engagement, Creativity, Perseverance, Optimism, Self-control, and Curiosity are taught deliberately and with forethought in every lesson, in tutorial encounters and throughout our co-curriculum. It is not enough to have an assembly once a week in which pupils are encouraged to be nice to each other. Instead, our rewards and sanctions, the way we praise and encourage day to day, and the way we respond to poor behaviour or attitude are underpinned by a Character Education philosophy. We work hard to enable our pupils to know that their thoughts inform their actions, their actions their habits, their habits their character, and that their character will ultimately determine their fortune. In 2020, we were delighted to be awarded a \u2018School of Character Quality Mark\u2019 from the Association for Character Education (ACE). This prestigious accolade is presented to schools that can demonstrate an explicit, planned and reflective approach to the cultivation of positive character attributes in their pupils in the interests of human flourishing. As one of only 17 schools worldwide to have achieved this recognition, we are suitably proud. Our thanks to our incredible staff for all their work embedding Character as the corner stone of our culture at Lord Wandsworth College. \u2014",

St Neot\u2019s is a leading independent, co-educational nursery, pre-prep and prep school which welcomes pupils from 2 to 13 years. It is set in a wonderful 70-acre woodland site in Eversley, Hampshire. There has been a strong relationship between the two schools over many years, with a significant proportion of St Neot\u2019s families choosing LWC for their children\u2019s secondary education. The collaboration between the two schools, both with a demonstrable record of academic and sporting success, now offers a unique educational pathway from 2 to 18 years. Adam Williams, Headmaster of LWC, said \u2018I am excited by this joint venture because our philosophies of education are so aligned. Both schools deliver academic excellence but importantly create opportunities that will embed character traits that form the whole person; traits which equip our young people to want to make a positive contribution in whichever society they live, anywhere in the world. There are few all-through schools that have the development of life skills and respect for the environment so deeply embedded in the daily life of the pupil. This alignment will help us plan a \u2018flightpath\u2019 for each child, giving them inner self-confidence, a necessity for the modern world.\u2019 Jonathan Slot was announced as Head of St Neot\u2019s and joined in September 2021. Jonathan was formally at Eagle House School, Berkshire, where he was Deputy Head and both Adam Williams and LWC\u2019s Governing Body were delighted to welcome him to St Neot\u2019s. Jonathan said \u2018Teaching is my passion. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead St Neot\u2019s into the next chapter, which will be all the more exciting thanks to this alignment with Lord Wandsworth College. I know and admire LWC, having sent children there from Eagle House over the last six years and watched them flourish. I can already see many exciting benefits for the St Neot\u2019s pupils in this future close collaboration.\u2019 Both schools have since tightened their alliance, now sharing some of LWC\u2019s senior business staff, working collaboratively on strategy and future projects.",

Equally, education which does not stretch and challenge denies pupils the chance to deepen and enrich their understanding of the world in which they live. All pupils, whatever their academic level, can benefit from stretch and challenge within their academic studies. Our Aiming High programme, led by Dr Esther Haydock, encourages the very best from our pupils whether they are academic scholars, aspiring Astronomists or those just looking to delve further into their subjects.",

It is for Lower and Upper Sixth Form students who aspire to become either a Vet, Doctor or Dentist. The focus is to identify the skills and experience that each individual student needs to secure a place for their chosen path. Certainly, the first step to securing an interview requires a stand-out personal statement and good UCAT score and this is something which we concentrate heavily on, giving students both confidence and a strong basis for their UCAS application. However, students also need to be exposed to current issues and thinking in their field, and to be able to reflect on this. Our Saturday mornings facilitate peer discussions around these important topics to expand a student\u2019s knowledge as well as building their confidence for interviews. In Upper Sixth, the focus shifts to the selection process and practicing the skills required for the many different types of interview carried out by the Universities. The journey towards a Dentist, Vet or Doctor is an exciting one and our Saturday morning focus group aims to enthuse and motivate our students along the way. Students are also supported at other times as needed and are always encouraged to suggest ideas and activities for us to pursue.",

The girls are supportive of each other in a number of ways, from using Pupil Voice in House Council, working together with Subject Ambassadors who offer help with prep to sitting in the foyer just chatting about their day.

Kindness is central to all we do in Park and we actively champion each other\u2019s achievements which makes it a vibrant place where the girls work together as a family. We believe at Park that education is not limited to the classroom; it is about cultivating an atmosphere, a culture, which encourages pupils in their own endeavours but also brings them together as a cohort, as a collective voice. At the heart of the House (whether as a Day pupil, a Flexi, a Weekly or a Full boarder) is the aim to inspire pupils to find out what makes them tick as an individual and to allow them to thrive in a safe and nurturing environment. The House is a beautiful old barn conversion, situated at the top of campus looking out onto expanses of fields and woodland. With our own sunken garden, there are plenty of opportunities to socialise with the other houses and year groups at BBQs and Tea Parties throughout the year. I am very lucky to have such a superb staff team, including 6 Tutors, 2 Matrons (Jackie & Mel) and our Assistant House Parent, Kate Henley. All staff play a pivotal role in supporting the girls both academically and pastorally and it is this family environment that makes Park home from home. Tutors encourage the girls to challenge themselves academically, whilst adopting exceptional A2RH habits and stretching themselves with the vast amount of opportunities we have here at LWC. We want all pupils to know that they are not the sum of their grades but the sum of their actions. We also want them to be graciously confident in their abilities, to be voices of change, embrace leadership opportunities and to look outside of LWC for wider enrichment opportunities such as charity and outreach. Do come and visit us at any time so that you can get a feel of the house and how it encompasses all of LWC\u2019s values; we\u2019d be delighted to give you a tour.",

This is a House where you thrive as an individual but its inclusive culture is also enviable. We are fortunate to have a highly experienced team at School House; Lewis Starbuck is Assistant Houseparent and our exceptional matrons, complete the day-to-day support of the boys in House. There is also a very strong tutor team with many years of pastoral experience to help the academic and holistic well-being of the boys. On a personal note, I\u2019m married to Wendy (an engineer from Chicago) and I have been a teacher with pastoral responsibilities for over 20 years. I have three teenage sons and have therefore experienced a huge amount from a parenting perspective. School House now includes an additional 76 teenage \u2018sons\u2019! The House\u2019s location at the very heart of the College means that the boys have access to all the nearby facilities including the playing fields right outside the front door and a short walk to breakfast, lunch and supper in the school dining room. The House has a large common room, a games room with full size snooker table, a massively sociable kitchen area for all boys, as well as a Sixth Form kitchen of their own. School House also benefits from May Court, a great central courtyard area for entertaining and unwinding, that is often used for BBQs during one of Hampshire\u2019s warm evenings. Senior boys in the House take responsibility for assisting the younger boys with their academic studies, as well as running the Friday evening activities, House socials, the tuck shop and charity activities in House.

        "content": "Most schools involve parents via reports, emails, parents\u2019 evenings and newsletters; all-important in their own right. However, it is engagement that has produced the greatest effects on student outcomes, whether related to academic results, future salary, higher life expectancy, better mental health or enhanced parent-child relationships. A rarity in UK schools, authentic engagement involves the school and parents working closely together to develop a common understanding about what great development looks and feels like for our children. At LWC our programme focuses on sharing accessible, practical, research-informed strategies with all parents and the visiting speakers involved are all engaged in working with staff, students or both at other times during the school year. This focus on developing sustainable relationships enables us \u2013 the team around each young person \u2013 to develop greater shared understanding. In time, this leads to a more coherent and effective culture around each child and a greater chance of accessing the better outcomes outlined above. The PEP talks are a mixture of online and in-person sessions and are designed to engender conversation between parents wherever possible and allow time for questions of the speaker and/or LWC representative. I look forward to seeing you at the next session and our collective thanks in advance for the continued support shown towards your children\u2019s development. Alex Battison Senior Deputy Head",

LWC strives to be inclusive and to treat its employees fairly.\u00a0 LWC also recognises that change takes time and requires concerted effort over the medium to long term to deliver meaningful and sustainable change. LWC is committed to continually reviewing its processes and policies, including equality, diversity and inclusion. LWC will be taking consideration of this forward as part of its wider approach to inclusion and belonging across the College. LWC will review policies and practices including recruitment and career paths; and explore the behaviours that may present barriers to retention and progression. LWC is working on clearer pay structures across all roles, and this has been put in place over the last year for all teaching and business roles. Continuous professional development is open to everyone and can be promoted particularly to groups under-represented at more senior levels. This is an early and first step towards addressing progression. LWC successfully ran its first Leadership and Management Course for staff in 2023 and will do the same again in 2024. This is to develop and encourage all to be able to progress. I can confirm that the data provided above is accurate and correct. Baz Bennett Chief Operating Officer March 2024",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 6 July 2022 An inspiring trip for our 4th Form this term who visited Hadrian\u2019s Wall to support their Latin and Classics GCSEs.\u2018We are all studying Latin or Classics for GCSE, and this trip gave us a chance to see what we had learnt first hand. The journey from school to the hostel was a long seven hours. Over the weekend, we visited multiple Roman forts, which required a lot of walking (but it was worth it to see the views!). These forts were where the soldiers who manned the wall lived and where they spent the majority of their time. Unsurprisingly, the fort was not as spectacular as it was in its glory days, but it was still very interesting to see how much historians could piece together so much about the Romans from the little information they had.We also had the opportunity to visit some museums that gave us more insight into the living conditions of these soldiers and their families. They were very interactive, and there was even a Roman board game available to play at one of them. Whilst at the fort named Vindolanda, there was an informative but humorous play depicting the time before the wall was built, and what was happening as it was being built. It showed the conflicts occurring across what is now the border between England and Scotland. Despite the weather not being on our side, the play was very enjoyable in the end and helped educate us about that time period in England.To sum up, it was a brilliant trip! We learnt so much and had fun doing so!Many thanks to all the staff who came with us and gave up their weekend to escort us.\u2019Amrit Tatla, 4th Form Back to all News",

        "title": "A PINEAPPLE, A WOLF, AND OUR FIRST LWC PILLAR OF +1",
        "content": "Adam Williams  | 22 April 2023 Shaped like a giant pinecone with a voluminous crown, the pineapple immediately commands attention. Coveted for centuries by kings for its scarcity and stately appearance, the pineapple became a worldwide obsession at the beginning of the 16th Century. Europe\u2019s royal houses paid thousands in today\u2019s money for just one fruit to put on display as the centrepiece at their tables. It was the ultimate symbol of wealth and was christened the \u201cKing of Fruit\u201d.Beyond its exalted status, mathematicians discovered the pineapple\u2019s prickly skin is a natural Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers in which each consecutive number is found by adding the two previous numbers together. This fact only seemed to enhance the fruit\u2019s genuine allure. But it also became a shameless emblem of the financial and social inequality between the classes throughout Europe at the height of the tropical fruit\u2019s obsession. A fledgling nation would help bring the pineapple back down to earth and soften its image to that of warm welcomes, celebration and hospitality.The pineapple is thought to have originated in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. The fruit was worshiped by the Tupinamba people, who had settled in the region approximately 3000 years ago. Pineapples were an integral part of daily life for the Tupi people. The Tupi not only ate the indigenous pineapple, but also used its meat to make wine and medicines, and even crafted poison arrows from its leaves and skins. It was considered a powerful symbol of fertility and prosperity.The first documented European encounter came in 1493 when Christopher Columbus is said to have discovered pineapples growing in clusters in a deserted Caribbean village, possibly on the island of Guadeloupe. Intrigued by this unusual, pod-like fruit, he cut a few pineapples from their stalks to bring back to Spain to present to his sponsor, King Ferdinand. Little did he know that this golden gift, nestled among the tame parrots, tomatoes, tobacco, and pumpkins, would be the crowning glory of his cargo.The purposeful pursuit of pineapples in Europe had begun.By the 1550\u2019s, pineapples were being shipped regularly from the Caribbean to Europe. The fruit was costly cargo and often rotted in the bowels of ships during the long journey north. This made the pineapple a rare luxury few, other than heads of state, could afford to procure. One pineapple could cost as much at \u00a35000 in today\u2019s money. Indeed, King Charles II of England commissioned a portrait of himself receiving a pineapple as a gift. It was the ultimate display of royal superiority over his subjects.Demand by Europe\u2019s elite for pineapples greatly outweighed supplies which meant that finding methods to preserve the precious fruit during the long, hot journey across the ocean were imperative. Eventually, merchant sea captains discovered that the pineapples could be either candied or packed in sugar, itself an equally costly luxury, to preserve them. With the preservation problem solved, pineapples became the must-have centrepieces for extravagant banquets as they showcased the immense wealth and power of the host. Guests were to feel slightly intimidated by these ostentatious displays, yet, honoured that no expense was spared for their enjoyment. For those who could not afford to purchase the fruit, shops and merchants would rent pineapples for the day as a cost and face-saving measure.By the beginning of the 18th Century, the image of the pineapple could be found painted on fine China, carved into columns or sculpted and placed on pillars at the entrances to palaces, churches and grand homes throughout England and France. Pineapple wallpaper and stencil work covered the walls of the most fashionable manor houses.There are theories as to why the pineapple became an architectural feature outside and throughout the home. Some historians believe this custom was first introduced in Europe by wealthy travellers returning from the New World, who found pineapples hung outside the entrances to Caribbean villages. They were greeted warmly by the native people and believed the pineapple to be a sign of welcome. Others claim a pineapple was placed outside the homes of sea captains to alert townsfolk of their safe return from the tropics. It served as an invitation by the family to stop by for refreshments and hear tales of the captain\u2019s time at sea.Whilst once representing unreachable wealth, the pineapple now represents warm welcome, celebration and unconditional hospitality.And what of it?You have patiently read to this point as I have talked of pineapples and wolves. I promise I am not losing my marbles, so let\u2019s go back to those first images. I talked to the pupils a little while ago about the wolf being an apex predator and the biodiversity that flourished with the wolves in Yellowstone (please do watch this clip \u2013 it is brilliant). I also asked them to consider what the apex behavioural trait would be that would allow our community to flourish. In fact, all communities. Kindness and welcome came to the fore. Our +1.For many years we have called our iconic, Southerly facing LWC gates, the Acorn Gates. We have walked through them a thousand times. We started and finished the Beckwith through them. But I wonder\u2026Are they actually acorns atop these pillars, or are they pineapples, standing like sentinels of welcome and kindness from the Caribbean as those first pupils (and thousands beyond) joined the school, or are they the acorns of a mighty oak standing proudly and resiliently as Britain\u2019s most eminent and powerful tree? Your challenge is to have a look, to discuss and to decide, as you head off for one of Mr Hedley\u2019s terrific match teas\u2026. I guarantee, you\u2019ll start noticing pineapples or acorns all over the south-east of the UK once you start looking\u2026 Back to all News",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 26 January 2022 Alex Battison is Senior Deputy Head at Lord Wandsworth College. He is also Chair of Educational Futures as part of Harvard University\u2019s Human Flourishing Programme, runs a think tank on the future of education and is a member of the Association of Professional Futurists. Alex is a Leadership Coach for the Premier League\u2019s Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS) where he works with top flight professional football coaches to develop their leadership in high performance environments. He has a Masters from Oxford University in Learning and Teaching and is currently towards the latter stages of his Doctorate in Leadership, Learning and Policy at Bristol.Alex was recently interviewed for the Inspiring Schools Podcast with Simon Noakes, Founder and CEO of digital marketing company Interactive Schools. Alex talks about school futures, inspirational school leadership, anchoring on a purpose, and developing courage & perseverance in our students. Listen to the Podcast here.Below Alex talks about his vision for the future of education:Often described using the American military term \u2018VUCA\u2019 (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous), we are all living in an immensely challenging world. Apart from a recent pandemic, common local, national and global issues include: widespread and radical social inequalities, the exponential growth in computational processing capacity (Moore\u2019s Law); energy, mineral resource and climate change as significant issues; the continued rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning; an ageing global population; the rise of globalisation and migration; the break-up of family and social ties; multiculturalism and weakening civic engagement.Over the course of my career to date I have spent much of my research focussed on how we can re-imagine education for the future so that our young people can thrive in meeting these challenges head on; in short, I no longer believe that our educational system is sufficient for the times in which we live.The origins of the way schools are designed and have been sustained are well documented elsewhere and I don\u2019t seek to repeat that here; moreover, the narrative within schools that I intend to focus on is the current status quo of preparation. Schools the world over talk of preparing young people for their futures, a future that is going to happen to them (as if they should batten down the hatches, wait for the storm to hit, and then see if they can navigate through it). Instead, I passionately believe that a revolution in schools should be driven by a mindset of creation; of enabling young people to view their futures as something that they can directly affect, create, influence, change and lead. It is our mindset that we must change first, and our education system needs that shift.What is also critical, is that students approach their futures with hope; that they face their lives with a purpose underpinned by their ABC\u2019s of ambition, belief and courage. Indeed, in spite of the world being VUCA (and who doesn\u2019t like a challenge anyway!), it is also an amazing place full of opportunity, joy and vibrancy that needs inspirational young people to exert their influence on it; schools can do so much more to enable that.Motivated by this mindset, this series of articles will be about trying to re-imagine education as a site for realising the relentless potential of our young people as active agents of change. It is about challenging the status quo, creating the spaces and structures for our young people to act with influence, to have a voice, and to meaningfully participate in schools and communities. It will address how we can better enable purposeful, passionate changemakers of the present who are empowered to create their futures. Back to all News",

        "title": "BLESSING OF THE BANNERS",
        "content": "Admm8h  | 2 November 2021 Lord Wandsworth College Blessing of the CCF Banners ParadeOn Friday the 15th of October 2021 the CCF of Lord Wandsworth College held a once in thirty years ceremony of the blessing of the banners. It was a very big event and the whole school attended to watch, with a massive chinook stood proud behind them.I was quite excited for the blessing of the banners (not just because I got to miss period 2!) but because I had heard that it was a once in thirty years event so not many people would be able to experience it let alone be a part of it. It was almost like seeing something like a lunar eclipse but instead of watching it from earth, I was the moon and everyone was watching me.As they were moving towards the parade, the cadets gathered by the sports field and were surprised to see a chinook land behind the parade ground. There was plenty of frantic videoing and amazed shouting. \u201cIt just circled closer and closer until we realised that it was actually landing!\u201d said one cadet. As the chinook\u2019s blades spun rapidly in the air all the cadets around me stood in awe. When we were lining up to start marching, I could feel the nervous excitement around me. As we heard the start of the drums and the bagpipes we started to march down to the war memorial area.As we marched down from Sutton Hall to the field in front of the war memorial the realisation of how big an occasion this was really hit me like a brick wall. I could see the whole school waiting expectantly as I got nearer the field and I could pick out the people I knew: my sister, my mates, my teachers and my housemaster. The whole school had gathered, and it was immense. As we marched into ranks, I could see the banners in front of me; they were spectacular.In practice we\u2019d had a couple of struggles with the halt as we hit the parade square and so I was slightly sceptical on how much of a fool I\u2019d look when I wouldn\u2019t hear the call \u2018HALT!\u2019 But like the rest of the ceremony, it was smooth and without a mistake.We all stood still until commanded. When we were at attention the Lord Lieutenant walked in through the gates along with the headmaster. This was when we all felt proud of our contingent. The blessing of the banners was continued after a series of commands in the banner party. The banners were presented and then blessed by a priest. This was a very important part of the ceremony and so everyone was silent during it. I can officially say that I have now spoken to a Queen\u2019s representative, it was such an honour. That\u2019s right, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire spoke to me.As the Lord Lieutenant was making his speech I realised that soon the ceremony would be over. And towards the end, I felt very lucky and privileged. I was able to be a part of this once in thirty years ceremony. Only a few people can say that. And that was one of the most amazing things about that day\u2026 I took part in the blessing of the banners.\u201cEven though it was difficult, it was rewarding and fun.\u201d said one of the cadets in the Banner Party. \u201cThis parade was especially important as many people have died protecting their regimental banners, so we give them the utmost care and respect they deserve.\u201dWhen we had finished our parade, we saw an amazing show of Gazelle helicopters. They weaved in and out of each other like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. . \u201cIt was like a scene from an action movie!\u201d said one enthusiastic cadet. They hung there for a bit, letting everyone turn around in amazement, and then flashed their lights in sync. Turning around, they both flew over so that they were over the sports field and started to dive, pulling up to form a wide arc. They then drifted round 180 degrees and dived down again. As one excited student put it: \u201cAn aerial half-pipe!\u201d As the aerobatics finished and the Gazelles landed to great applause, the cadets, for all their hard work, were able to meet the pilots and see the engines and cockpits of the helicopters.All in all the whole day was an experience I will never forget and I was so honoured to be a part of it. LWC\u2019s blessing of the banners parade was one of those moments I don\u2019t think I will ever forget.Written by cadets from Lord Wandsworth College:Cdt Caitlin Loten, Cdt Grace Batley, Cdt Zack Williams, Cdt Will HoylandFeatured on the Combined Cadet Force website:Combined Cadet Force | Lord Wandsworth College Blessing of the CCF\u2026 Back to all News",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 1 February 2023 On Friday 20th January, Sophie P, Kenzie S and I, plus our two wonderful teachers, Mr Lovell and Mrs Lambe, travelled to Calais, with little idea what our weekend would hold. Whilst on the ferry from Dover, the five of us discussed our feelings regarding what we were expecting; our worries, excitement, and anticipation.On Saturday morning we met with the wonderful people at the volunteer-led charity, Care4Calais, who instantly created a friendly atmosphere in the warehouse. We spent the morning doing various jobs around the warehouse, such as sorting through donations of jumpers and quality checking them before boxing them for distribution. This was really productive and gave us a chance to talk to other volunteers about their stories and experiences in Calais. After a short lunch break, we were briefed on our site visit that was to follow in the afternoon, and then made our way via cars and minibuses to a site named Rue de Jud\u00e9e, which was a field on the side of a road in the outer suburbs.When we arrived, one half of the team began distributing brand new joggers to a group of Sudanese refugees who were able to choose their sizes and the colour of their joggers, giving them back an element of autonomy. Whilst the distribution was occurring, the other half of the team set up the services which Care4Calais provide to these refugees seven days a week at a variety of sites across the region. These services included large charging ports, hair cutting stations, hot drinks, games such as a football and board games, sewing and friendship bracelets, English lessons, and information about Rwanda and how Care4Calais can help the refugees if they find themselves under threat of deportation to Rwanda. Through this site, we were able to talk to a vast spread of refugees, who talked about their journeys from their origin countries to Calais and their plan for the future, regarding getting to England. There was an overall sense of hope and excitement amongst the site and at the peak there were approximately 200 people, with music playing through a speaker, people chatting, playing football, and having fun. During pack down, as we prepared to return to the warehouse, everyone helped to pack away tables and chairs and helped to clear up \u2013 showing unity and a mutual sense of respect and gratitude between both volunteers and refugees.The second day followed a similar pattern, with warehouse work in the morning (this time splitting large food packages into smaller bags in preparation for distribution later in the week) and then a lunch time briefing for the afternoon ahead. On Sunday we were heading for Calais city centre, to a regular site the team visit, which is near to where predominantly Syrian refugees are staying.When we arrived, half the team distributed second-hand coats whilst the other half set up the services in a similar manner to the day before, with others chatting with the refugees about their stories. Only the night before had a large group of them attempted to cross the channel, when the French police slashed their inflatable boats whilst out at sea and removed their motors \u2013 telling us how this was not an uncommon occurrence yet how they swam back to Calais, with only a couple injured. This failed attempt had not hindered the mood, as the atmosphere at this site was similar to the day before, with a large sense of community spirit and hope despite the immense challenges and hardships they were all facing day-to-day.This trip has taught us a lot. We learnt a huge amount regarding how the refugees are treated by authorities, about their lives before fleeing their origin countries and about what Care4Calais do to offer support to the refugees, providing essential resources and a listening ear. It has also taught us more about gratitude regarding the opportunities we have been given and that we are able to go to a school that provides these opportunities and allows us to help others whilst developing our personal skills such as communication, inclusion, and confidence in social situations. We aim to work with Care4Calais again, getting more people involved with volunteering and raising money to support the incredible work the charity does and crucial impact it plays in the humanitarian crisis in Calais.Written by Leon M, L6 Back to all News",

The grounds had been lit up to enhance our beautiful, historic buildings and we were blessed with mild weather which meant the whole campus twinkled magically in the darkness. As staff and pupils arrived, they were treated to hot chocolate and Christmas cake to get them in the festive mood. Mr White had assembled a scratch choir who led the way with the carols and encouraged even the most hesitant of our singers to join in! They were accompanied by our talented Director and Assistant Director of Music, Mrs Lane and Mr Parker, on piano and drums.Ahead of the event, our wonderful Chaplain, Pete Maidment had spent days filming and editing some delightful vignettes from Tiggy, Will, Lulu, Mr Rimmer and Miss Liggins, who had chosen their favourite Christmas carol and shared their reasons with the audience, in a series of short films.We had poignant readings delivered by Amelia, Hal and the Headmaster, followed by the Chaplain\u2019s much anticipated (and ever-entertaining) sermon, which this year included an unexpected Covid twist that saw the 3 Wise Men having to isolate at a Travel Lodge somewhere near Basingstoke!The crowd delighted in singing the classics; O Little Town of Bethlehem, O come, all ye faithful, Good King Wences\u2019las and Silent Night but the clear favourite was Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer! Pupils and staff alike giggled as everyone \u2018sang along with glee\u2019!Thank you so much to the awesome team that made this such a special LWC evening. We were hugely disappointed not to be able to have parents on site with us this year due to Government guidance. We are keeping our festive fingers crossed for 2022! Back to all News",

We had a great mix of senior and junior cadets, including some of our brand new 3rdForm recruits who have only been in the Cadet Force for two weeks!We spent some of the time navigating in the hills of Snowdonia, including climbing the impressive north ridge of Tryfan, leading to one of the iconic summits of North Wales. We also had some days on mountain bikes in the forests of Coed y Brenin. The cadets were coached on bike handling and riding techniques and then got to put their new-found skills to practice on the trails around the forest. They demonstrated some very impressive riding; whether they were seasoned experts or brand new to mountain biking, all the cadets put in a good performance and showed great resilience around the course.We enjoyed much of the weather that North Wales has to offer, and were frequently given a good dousing when the heavens opened on us! We did enjoy a few bursts of sunshine between the downpours though. We thought we had escaped the weather on the final day when we went to explore on old slate mine. As we walked through the forest to the small entrance to the mine, we might have thought that would be the end of the rain and soaked clothing. Once inside however, it became clear that we were surrounded by water. An underground boat ride through the inner caverns, a zip wire over a deep pool and a climb up through a waterfall, all did an excellent job of ensuring we stayed wet!The cadets showed real character during the week. We saw some great examples of leadership from the senior cadets and perseverance and resilience from the younger cadets, for some of whom these activities were more challenging. It was also very rewarding to see the help and support that the cadets gave each other when they realised that one of their group was struggling. These are the qualities that we know the cadets gain from a week of adventure training, as much as the enjoyment of working in their teams and learning new outdoor skills.Thank you to my able team; Jamie Lancey, Ian Kerr, Richard Lovell, Georgia Bowers and Aubrey Collins.

Both days were filled with live performances of music and dance, there was a funfair, a motor show, a mini farm and so much more in what really was a celebration to remember!To kick things off on Friday, we hosted a fantastic evening of music, showcasing our talented pupils. We were dazzled by our incredible Centenary Choir and the Concert Band with special Sternian guests playing throughout the evening. The brilliant Paul Sykes Big Band closed the show with his team of 17 musicians!The crowds feasted on the culinary delights from our delicious food village, serving up everything from pizza to paella, gourmet burgers, chilli and sushi, with plenty of mouthwatering drinks from the Centenary Bar, kindly supported by the fantastic team at The Red Lion, Odiham.A magical fireworks finale closed the show and guests headed home regaling wonderful stories of the event.On Saturday we ramped up the festivities with some fantastic rides; a vintage ferris wheel and dodgem cars. Paul Sigley, our Farm Manager, delighted guests with tractor rides across the fields and campus, taking in wonderful LWC landmarks.Throughout the day there was more incredible music from pupils and Sternians, along with fantastic dance performances, drama solos and group showcases from our talented performing artists. The Art School had excelled themselves with several stunning exhibitions across the campus along with Miss Hampson\u2019s excellent \u2018100 Portraits\u2019 of our Junior pupils to commemorate our Centenary.We topped the event off with the excellent \u2018Real Love\u2019, a seven-piece pop band, who played a mix of contemporary chart hits, whilst guests danced the early evening away!

The crowds feasted on the culinary delights from our delicious food village, serving up everything from pizza to paella, gourmet burgers, chilli and sushi, with plenty of mouthwatering drinks from the Centenary Bar, kindly supported by the fantastic team at The Red Lion, Odiham. A magical fireworks finale closed the show and guests headed home regaling wonderful stories of the event. On Saturday we ramped up the festivities with some fantastic rides; a vintage ferris wheel and dodgem cars. Paul Sigley, our Farm Manager, delighted guests with tractor rides across the fields and campus, taking in wonderful LWC landmarks. Throughout the day there was more incredible music from pupils and Sternians, along with fantastic dance performances, drama solos and group showcases from our talented performing artists. The Art School had excelled themselves with several stunning exhibitions across the campus along with Miss Hampson\u2019s excellent \u2018100 Portraits\u2019 of our Junior pupils to commemorate our Centenary. We topped the event off with the excellent \u2018Real Love\u2019, a seven-piece pop band, who played a mix of contemporary chart hits, whilst guests danced the early evening away!",

Students from every year group ran anything from 5 to 20+ kilometres along this ancient path to raise funds for the incredible Lord Wandsworth Foundation, enabling children who have lost the support of one or both parents to access the most amazing education at Lord Wandsworth College.If that wasn\u2019t enough to encourage your generosity, one intrepid runner, Mr Pyper attempted to run all 100km of the path alongside the relay race.The event was incredible! 100km reached in just under 12 hours. Everyone went above and beyond, running well beyond what they\u2019d planned, keeping going even when everything hurt and smashing all our expectations \u2013 incredible work. Huge congratulations to Gerry (5th Form), who put us all to shame with an incredible 58k under his belt and to Phoebe who planned to run 5k and clocked up 30k by the time we finished.Thanks again for all your support \u2013 the sponsorship page is still open should you wish to donate:https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/thechaplainschallenge Back to all News",

This was cancelled due to Covid, as was the 2021 race so instead we created and trained for our own version, the Thames Challenge. This event would cover the same distance of 125 miles with a half marathon of portages (picking up the boat and carrying it between locks).The course started at Lechlade and finished in Teddington. Because we were not racing competitively, the four boats that took part: myself and Ewan, Hal and Tom, Charlie and Ciara and Amber and Ethan, were able to stay as a group and motivate each other in a variety of ways, such as singing, much to the delight of other river users (!!), helping us to grow as a team. The entire journey has been a highlight for me at LWC, mainly because of the people but also because of the things we have accomplished, including fund raising over three times our original target of \u00a31000 for Breast Cancer Now.Our thanks must go to everyone who made it possible: our Coach Richard, our Headmaster, Mr Mobbs and Miss Mobbs for training and paddling with us, Ms D-C, Tony Gray and our amazing support crew. It would not have been possible without them, and we all are hugely proud of what our team has achieved, an excellent way to finish mine and Ewan\u2019s time at LWC.Ellen G and Ewan O Back to all News",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 18 November 2022 Responding to the exciting news that LWC has again been named in the Top 100 Cricket Schools, Joint 1st XI Captain, Sam R, had this to say:LWC Cricket means absolutely everything to me. It is what I look forward to all year. Having training sessions in the blazing sunshine after school and playing matches in front of a home crowd is the most amazing feeling. Having the support of all friends and peers at school is something that is very special here. It is a chance to show people that we can compete amongst the best of the best in the country.I think that as a school we allow our youth to perform against the best schools. Especially over the last 2 years, there has been a major cohort of 4th and 5th Formers, and even a few 3rd Form, getting the opportunity to show what they can do! In my opinion, the focus that we have on girls\u2019 cricket is outstanding. Mr Ikin is really ensuring that there is equity here and the girls are getting the same high-quality training as the boys. We train together on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and it is a good chance for us to bond.Moreover, I think the best thing we do as a school is celebrating the achievements of individuals, whether that be in or out of school. An example of this was during the season last year, three of us were awarded the first ever LWC Cricket Honours Caps.Personally, the thing I enjoy most about cricket is the team environment. Whether on the pitch, in the changing room or even going out for a team meal at the end of the season. I love seeing my teammates around school and having interactions with them, even if they are not in my year. The environment around training is amazing as well. We have a competitive nature but also an environment where we are trying to help each other improve.LWC Cricket has allowed me to develop in a way which I would never have thought. I cannot be more thankful to the staff who have helped me. I have spent endless hours with Mr Ikin doing 1 to 1 batting sessions which have helped me so much. It has also allowed me to develop my leadership skills. From captaining the 1st XI twice in 5th Form, to being vice captain in L6th and now becoming joint captain, alongside Archie Oscroft, is a real honour. I have learned so many things about leadership and communication skills which are going to be vital for me going forward.Our cricket facilities at LWC are second to none. The grass nets are always in pristine condition throughout the summer, with the grounds staff spending endless hours preparing and maintaining them after training. The pavilion was refurbished before last season and it is genuinely incredible. From what it used to be, to have a space that we can all be proud of and call our cricketing home, is such an amazing feeling. The pitches are unbelievable! The grounds staff create some absolute belters, which is such a soothing feeling when you win a toss and choose to bat on a sunny day at LWC! Back to all News",

The training programme and community spirit this event requires provides so much more than just preparation for the race. While the long paddling sessions and the repetitive process of falling into freezing cold water at the start of the programme cultivates character traits like perseverance and determination, elements of kindness, exemplified when someone offers to tie up another person\u2019s kayak on a dark cold evening after they have fallen in the canal, or cooking someone else dinner on the DW race demonstrates the strong feeling of comradeship the kayaking team create during the training process. The race itself was a phenomenal experience. You use the skills from training to not only power through physical turmoil, but \u201cdig deep\u201d, and overcome mental challenges too. Something else to note is how unique the LWC support team are. The enthusiasm from the parents and other side-line supporters provide a real uplift to the paddlers, and our school\u2019s system in which parents support and feed everyone in the team, not just their own, develops a real sense of community. There are two morning gym sessions starting at 7am, in addition to the three paddling sessions and one afternoon paddling machine session in the gym each week. Wednesdays encompass a long paddle, whereas Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings focus on technique and sprints. From a female perspective, I feel the morning gym sessions were also quite empowering, as they introduce students to different training exercises and teach you how to train with the correct technique so that you can confidently use the gym without much risk of injury. I will be carrying forward the lessons I\u2019ve learned with me onto university, and life beyond education.\u2019Rianna HThank you so much to Mr Lovell, Miss Mobbs, all the support crew and our fantastic LWC parents and families for helping make this event one to remember!

        "content": "Admm8h  | 26 February 2023 Senior Netball and Cricket Tour to DubaiA group of our 5th Form and Upper and Lower Sixth talented young sportsmen and sportswomen headed off to Dubai over half term. Dubai is brilliantly set up for netball and cricket and is known for being competitive, inclusive, and professional. In glorious weather, students had the opportunity to play against leading international schools, with the focus on building and preparing successful teams for the coming 2023 season. Alongside a busy training/playing schedule, the pupils were given time off to experience the culture and attractions of Dubai. Here, some of the team write about their experience. Many thanks to Mrs Courtney, Miss Davies, Mr Ikin and Mr Firth for organsing such an excellent trip.On our recent trip to Dubai, we enjoyed seeing lots of new things and experiencing great weather, whilst playing netball. Playing in 2 matches, 1 tournament, and 1 training session on the day we arrived, helped us execute a whole range of new skills, bringing our teams to work better than ever before. We enjoyed meals in and outside of the hotel, spending time to have a laugh and chat with everyone. This made it so fun for us all as we all got to relax and refresh after playing sport. Many of the girls\u2019 favourite days was visiting the Atlantis waterpark, everyone spent the day going on the craziest waterslides and playing in the sea, we even got Mrs Courtney and Miss Davies on a few! Another great day was spent in the desert with the entire group of both the netballers and the cricketers. We went from driving in jeeps through the desert, to riding camels and then enjoying a buffet in the centre of the desert. Our 1st team netball came out with 2/3 wins and made lots of memories playing together making us even more excited to continue the netball season together back at school. This was a trip of a lifetime and the girls couldn\u2019t be more grateful to have been taken to Dubai and experience everything we were able to do.Poppy M, L6Dubai 2023, all I can say is wow! Prior to going away, I had so many people tell me what an amazing country it was but it truly smashed all of my expectations out of the water. Upon arrival, I think it was fair to say that we were all shocked at how clean it was in Dubai, a big change from what we see in the UK! We had such a lovely mix of people on tour, ranging from Upper 6th down to 4th Form. It was lovely to see such a great integration between boys and girls and year groups. Moving onto sport, we were absolutely spoilt to train at such amazing facilities at the Dubai Sevens Stadium, a multi-sport centre which facilitated both of our needs on the tour, Cricket and Netball. In terms of the actual playing of sport, it was extremely successful, with an array of wins for both Netball teams and ending in the Cricket team winning 3 games out of 3. We believe it was one of the most successful tours in recent history, a feat that we are all very proud of!Last but certainly not least were the activities we were treated to. We were so fortunate to be able to take part in so many amazing experiences such as dune-buggying, camel riding, a desert bbq, Burj Khalifa trip and the Atlantis waterpark, which I think many would say was the highlight of the trip. Some of the slides were like lightning, which was so enthralling for all of us. A special thank you to Mr Ikin, Mr Firth, Mrs Courtney and Miss Davies who ran the tour superbly. I was lucky enough to go on tour to South Africa in 2020, but I must say this tour to Dubai was on a whole other level! A tour beyond belief, which we could not be more grateful for.Sam R, U6Dubai 2023 \u2013 where do I start! We all left from school very much in need of some sunshine, but weren\u2019t very sure what to expect. Upon arrival we were all shocked at how nice the hotel and area we were staying in was! The cricket team consisted of a mix from 4th-U6th Form, while the netball side consisted of just 6th Form and everyone integrated and got on very well. I think we all agree it was a very good trip for forming closer friendships with the different year groups. Now for the sport \u2013 the netball 1st team won their first game of the tour, despite the extremely hot playing conditions, and later in the tour both the netball 1st and 2nd team smashed it to win their last match of the tour. There was also a tough tournament where both teams worked together well to finish 6th place and 8th place. Around these games we were also lucky enough to train in the incredible Dubai sevens stadium. The cricket team pulled together to win 3 out of their 3 games \u2013 it is safe to say it was a successful tour for both boys and girls! But it didn\u2019t just stop at sport, we were lucky enough to be able to go to the Dubai desert, where many of us rode camels, went dune buggying, and finished with a desert BBQ. The Atlantis waterpark was definitely a hit with all years, and many said it was the highlight of the trip. We also went to see the Burj Khalifa which was amazing (it is 828m tall!). The girls ended their tour with a very much needed rest day, which of course was spent on the beach! Everyone loved this and some people also did various water sports available at the beach. Overall, it was an amazing trip which pulled our sports teams closer together, and also provided us with some unforgettable experiences. A special thank you to Miss Davies, Mrs Courtney, Mr Ikin and Mr Firth who organised and ran the trip incredibly. An unforgettable tour which everyone is really grateful for!Amelia S, L6 Back to all News",

The event is a celebration of the work of the Lord Wandsworth Foundation, which remains at the heart of all that we do here at LWC.We heard inspiring stories from Foundationers, past and present, listened to wonderful music performed by pupils and watched some heart warming films featuring pupils, sharing their LWC journey.Beth Jackson, our Foundation Prefect, did a fantastic job in hosting the event and commented:\u2018It was a really lovely day, finally being able to gather all together again, with former and current Foundationers, alongside charities and families who have been helped and supported by the Foundation.From my perspective, it was a somewhat challenging day too as I told my story of how I came to LWC and reflected on the time I have spent here before I leave and go to university.Foundation Day is also probably one of the most important dates in the school year as it provides an opportunity to gather with Foundationers and celebrate the origins of the College and how fundamental the Foundation is to life here.Overall, it was a wonderful day and I look forward to coming back over the years and celebrating the Foundation and everyone who has been helped by it.\u2019Leah Morgan from the Royal National Children\u2019s Springboard Foundation gave an inspiring and thought provoking speech outlining the support they provide for vulnerable children and the work they do with the Lord Wandsworth Foundation, having been linked with us for many years.For more information on the Foundation please go to:https://www.lordwandsworth.org/about-us/the-foundationOur pupils recorded some fantastic footage for the event.

These children benefit from the stability, structure, and pastoral care provided by its award-winning boarding environment. The Foundation remains as relevant today as when envisaged by its founder, Baron Sydney Stern, the Lord of Wandsworth.Since its inception, the Lord Wandsworth Foundation has helped over 2,500 young people who have had a difficult start in life.

Here they share their stories of their journey into cricket.Finty:I first stepped on a cricket field as a sub fielder for my brother\u2019s team in New Zealand when I was 7, and fell in love with the sport. I came back to the UK and joined St Cross Symondians Cricket Club aged 10, where I played with both girls and boys, and I was soon picked up for District and then U11 Hampshire.After a couple of rocky seasons and some hard work, I was picked for Hampshire and the Elite Player Pathway in 2019 and soon after, the Southern Vipers Regional Academy. After a good 2020 season, I made my debut for Hampshire Women this year in May 2021, soon followed with my Southern Vipers debut alongside my schoolmate Gemma.Gemma:My first experience of cricket was playing with my older brother in the garden. Then, aged 10, I joined Hartley Wintney CC, and at the end of that summer I was picked for the U11 County squad. I have been selected for Hampshire\u2019s county age group team every year since then.At Hartley Wintney, I played in the boys\u2019 U13A team as well as the girls team. Then, when I was 13, I moved to Odiham & Greywell CC to play in the boys\u2019 U15A team and the Women\u2019s team. When I was 16, I moved to Alton CC where I currently play for the Women\u2019s team. At LWC, I opened the bowling in the U14A and U15A boys\u2019 teams, and in 2021 became the first girl to be selected for the 1st XI.In 2018, when I was 15, I was first selected for the Southern Vipers Regional Academy. I made my senior county debut for Hampshire Women in 2020. Then, within a week of my 18th birthday in May 2021 I made my debut for the Southern Vipers and was awarded a semi-professional contract.Southern Vipers Announce 2021 Playing SquadFinty and Gemma receiving their caps from Head Coach, Charlotte Edwards CBE (Former Captain of the England Women\u2019s Cricket Team) Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 24 November 2023 It\u2019s the stuff of nightmares, the dinner-party opening gambit that invariably guarantees the person I\u2019m sitting next to quickly turns their shoulder away and begins a conversation across the table with someone else. I\u2019ve tried a range of answers over the years, from dolphin trainer to trainee astronaut, golf caddy to underground train driver.All elicit a pretty decent, though mildly incredulous response of \u201creally?\u201d followed by a subsidiary question or two before my cover is blown.\u00a0 And so to the truth\u2026 \u201cactually, I\u2019m a teacher.\u201d With these words, their exit strategy from the conversation begins (it\u2019s even quicker if you say you\u2019re a Head). But the thing is, and on behalf of all teachers out there, I should really be saying (with a large chunk of tongue in cheek) that \u201cI\u2019m a model\u201d \u2013 I could say \u2018modeller\u2019 but that has slightly different connotations\u2026To my untutored eye, the world (and the UK in particular) appears in total flux presently and I must confess to not quite understanding it. Socially, politically, economically, environmentally and demographically.\u00a0 And golf\u2026\u00a0 All are like spinning tops.Society and people seem quicker to criticise, to demand, to expect and to require. \u00a0And to shout at someone if it\u2019s not right. Ouch.\u00a0 And this is beyond the age-old differential societal debates of Baby boomers (1946-64), Generation X (1965-1980) Millennials (1981-1996), Gen Z (1997-2012) and Gen Alpha (2013-2025). There is also a group called the Xennials (those of the same age as Rishi Sunak) \u2013\u00a0 and are leading the nation, straddling Gen X and the Millennials. They were the first generation to grow up with computers and the internet at home.\u00a0 They witnessed the release of the Star Wars Trilogy (lucky things), but didn\u2019t have Twitter or Facebook to hand (again, lucky things).\u00a0\u00a0 They used rotary phones as teenagers, but loved an email to socialise later on.\u00a0 They\u2019ve had more than their fair share of collapses from dot coms to financials, and still manage a great work-life balance.\u00a0 Their transformational years were instructed by the Jedi Padawan, Luke Skywalker.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ll let you decide if that\u2019s a good thing.And this swirling world is one our quite remarkable and wonderful teenagers are stepping into; a world of beauty in so many parts, but also of confusion and nuance. A world with static noise and the ability to offend and upset with every sentence and statement, but also with immense opportunity.The world of education must stand firm and remain a reassuring constant and rock for them.\u00a0 It is exhausting and inspiring in equal measure to be a part of this, as society\u2019s tide of insecurity rushes past. In time though, the tide will turn and pull the other way as it does on the Thames and any other tidal river or estuary. It always does.Our teenagers today need to look really hard for the right role models, and when they find them, our media are often quick to highlight flaws in their character, often skipping the good stuff. I must confess, I am somewhat bemused as to how judgmental society has become, though having just turned 50, I am still many years away from moving to Tunbridge Wells and writing weekly correspondence to the editor of the Telegraph\u2026 (though wide-of-the-mark WhatsApp wonderings bring that ever closer\u2026) Don\u2019t get me wrong, outstanding role models are out there, but there is simply not a perfect package in any one individual.Our challenge (which we accept) as teachers and as parents is that we must ensure our character demonstrates those which are eulogy traits, not resum\u00e9 ones.One needs to pr\u00e9cis, distil and assimilate characteristics with care and attention \u2013 it\u2019s a personality-led version of Yo Sushi. Teenagers (in fact all of us) need role models; they help us to become even better people, they help inspire and challenge our own outlook and at times even make us feel better.\u00a0\u00a0 I can see Alicia Drummond nodding in agreement.In my nearly 30 year teaching career, I have seen the incredible impact of inspirational staff, though they are not always the folk one would expect.\u00a0 A school and a community needs its Miss Jean Brodies, Brian Cox\u2019s, Ben Stokes\u2019, brooding dramatists, inspirational musicians, outward-bound champions and iconic matrons. Their modelling impacts on different pupils at different stages of their lives and as a Head, it is wonderful to see such staff all in one school, even though one\u2019s management skillset can be put through its paces, notably in mid-November and later, in March every year.\u00a0 That\u2019s a different blog on the rhythm of human behaviours \u2026Teenagers need a voice, and watching them involved in taking genuine responsibility at LWC, I am consistently amazed and impressed by the way in which they undertake their responsibilities.\u00a0 From campus master planning, social and societal leadership, writing policies, creating school films, interviewing teachers for appointments, designing our landscape and buildings, peer mentoring, volunteering and coaching sport.\u00a0 They have a platform in which they role model for our younger years and genuinely embed their beliefs into our school culture.\u00a0 It is counterintuitive perhaps, but the more responsibility one gives teenagers, the more conservative they become \u2013 creating an environment where risk-taking is stimulated is very much our modus vivendi.Our pupils live such fast-paced lives with a constant smorgasbord of conflicting images and opinions on view, it is up to us as teachers to model consistently the behaviours that will provide the basis for their future lives. We must be motivators and optimists, demonstrate integrity and loyalty, trust and self-control each and every day. We must model what it is to be energetic, upset, resilient and courageous, to name but just a few. Pupils and parents are all too quick to pick up (and tell me) when we\u2019re not modelling properly, but we strive to do our very best\u2026LWC\u2019s complete immersion into Character Education provides a mandate for this and it is something we feel a strong connection to. Pupils (in fact, all at LWC) deserve for us to model character attributes constantly. That is why the teachers here are so committed, not only through their work in the classroom, but also to the co-curricular programme and pastoral life of our school.\u00a0 It is our way of life.\u00a0 The broader educational sector may be exhibiting all the signs of implosion before leading to a paradigm shift (and the upcoming election will only serve to intensify this), but our staff, both business and teaching, are utterly committed and love what they do. They are becoming ever braver and more ambitious too, which is incredibly exciting.And so, as the twinkle of Christmas lights begin to hover into view, we can pause and reflect.\u00a0 Alas, our looks may not get us onto the catwalks of Milan or feel the soft red carpet under our feet, and we will certainly never know what it is like to be Taylor Swift, George Clooney, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Idris Elba, Ellen MacArthur or Daniel Craig, but we do have the right when asked \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d to say \u201cI\u2019m a model\u201d\u2026 and then pass the bread rolls.

        "title": "HEADMASTER\u2019S BLOG: The Dark is exciting",
        "content": "Adam Williams  | 8 January 2024 Whilst tidying the house recently and pre-planning the somewhat pointless New Year\u2019s resolutions of a cleaner, tidier life, I came across a classic childhood book \u2013 The Owl who was afraid of the Dark. Beautifully illustrated, it explores the journey of an owlet learning about how wonderful the dark is and all that it offers, but from a position of \u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 It is about finding one\u2019s true self, speaking to strangers and about being open-minded. It is about thinking differently; amen to that.As we look outside, the winter solstice has now passed in the Northern Hemisphere as 21 December rolls into the rear-view mirror. It is the shortest (and therefore) darkest day of the year with only 7 hrs and 49 minutes hours of daylight in North Hampshire, compared to 16hrs and 38 minutes at the Summer solstice. Those latitudes north of 50 degrees are drifting into slumber, before the spring reawakening. And, yet, with the lights off, the world is very much alive.Crepuscular (that\u2019s your dawn and dusk crowd \u2013 including your cat) and nocturnal animals are coming into their own, not to mention the sky that is alive with stars and storytelling for those who have been embracing the books and shows of Brian Cox (The Planets, Cox and Cohen is awesome) or Tristan Gooley.Just 50 minutes east of LWC, there is no such thing as the darkness really, for London, the global megacity that it now is, is part of the world\u2019s 24-hour economy. The nightshift, so to speak, is alive and well with many workers resisting their body clocks (not a good thing if you read the research) and moving the nation onwards. Like the time and sleep, the nighttime economy refreshes what occurred in the day, so we can start again as the sun stretches its \u201crosy fingered dawn\u201d across the landscape. (I\u2019ve stolen that from Homer\u2019s Odyssey \u2013 love the phrase).But at LWC, darkness reigns supreme. With little light pollution, once the Flowers Science Centre turns off its motion-sensored lights, the stars blaze out, notably in Frog Lane, between Sutton /Park House and Sheephouse Copse.But let\u2019s take it up a notch and turn the lights out almost completely, and then throw in an ultra marathon\u2026 Let me introduce you to The Tunnel Ultra. 200 miles of continuous running in the darkness.To quote the organisers;\u2018The Tunnel is a mind-bending test of extreme endurance and sensory deprivation. This challenge is a 200 mile ultramarathon through the darkness of the UK\u2019S longest foot tunnel. You will run on flat terrain but in the pitch black between 11pm and 5am; there will be low level lighting in effect at other times.\u2019The Combe Down tunnel is in Bath, Somerset, and there will be a checkpoint at the south end of the tunnel. You will have 55 hours to run approximately 100 \u2018out-n-backs\u2019, or 200 times through the tunnel, which is possibly the greatest mileage ultramarathon ever run 99% underground.It is one of the ultimate tests in the UK. And if you want to enter\u2026The Tunnel | Cockbain Events LtdEven the Devizes to Westminster marathon canoe race, that nearly 40 of our pupils are undertaking in April this year (on the back on being National Schools champions in 2023), looks like a jaunty punt down the river compared to this. That said, please do ask if you want to find out more about how to come and watch / support our team compete, even if you haven\u2019t got a child racing! It is one of the best things that LWC pupils do, creating memories (and blisters) for life.But what do you do when the lights go out?, to almost quote Albus Dumbledore to Ron Weasley in Harry Potter, The Prisoner of Azkaban \u2013 in fact, I think the exact words were;\u201cHappiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light.\u201dJ K Rowling was on to something here, but beyond tunnels and Deluminators, the UK is seeing a resurgence in areas being designated as Dark Sky parks \u2013 we have six UK National Parks; Exmoor, Brecon Beacons, South Downs (Moore\u2019s Reserve), Snowdonia, North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales that have been awarded International Dark Sky Reserve status.Northumberland, with England\u2019s most pristine dark skies, is an International Dark Sky Park (Gold Tier). Now this really does have to be seen to be believed. And not forgetting Exmoor becoming Europe\u2019s first International Dark Sky Reserve in 2011, with its rugged moorland landscapes transforming at night into star-filled scenes. Top spots for stargazing there include Brendon Two Gates, Webbers Post, Ansley Gate, Haddon Hill, Wimblehall Lake and County Gate.And the darkest sky in the world? That honour goes to the NamibRand Nature Reserve, Namibia.NamibRand Nature Reserve | Dark Sky. Now there are a few holidays ideas for you\u2026But with the nights are drawing out and more light flooding back into our world, schools, like nature, will spring back into action, as will our energy levels. And to help with this, I thought you would appreciate reading the most recent external review of LWC undertaken by Talk Education, who visited us recently. Please do pass on to your friends and family. We are delighted with their feedback and will be working hard to raise our profile both regionally and nationally this year. Demand remains at record levels, but we will never become complacent, rather continue to challenge ourselves. Your feedback has been instrumental in this too, so thank you.Lord Wandsworth College \u2013 Senior school in Hook (talkeducation.com)Spending time at LWCI am delighted to provide the scoop that LWC will be (for the first time) opening our gardens as part of the National Garden Scheme early in the summer term and hope that more and more of you will start to visit Zanetas on a Saturday morning to enjoy the coffee and home baking. Our school is very much your school. Please come and enjoy the planting, the landscape and the environment.You will also have the chance to watch our newly formed girls\u2019 football teams playing this term (up at Southview), our netballers competing at the beautifully refurbished Bramley Centre and our boys playing an exciting brand of hockey as they hang onto the coat-tails of the girls success last term.In conclusionAnd so, with 2024 underway, there is much to look forward to. This year will see us apply to Hart DC for outline planning permission for our new strategic campus masterplan, come together for a wonderful Oliver! production at the Haymarket, Basingstoke and congratulate our 5th Formers on their English Language GCSE results, to name but a few elements. The views of what LWC might be this year are not quite as spectacular as those coming from the James Webb Space telescope peering out into the stellar darkness presently as we start to redefine our view of the Early Universe, but the ambition is the same\u2026 Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 29 September 2023 In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the mythical creature that guarded Hades, aka the gates of Hell.\u00a0\u00a0 And that was the name given to the heatwave that reeked its fiery breath over Europe this summer, not to mention melting what snow and ice that clings on in this part of the world.\u00a0 Now there\u2019s some good symbolism for you\u2026The world recorded its hottest day globally this year, and some scientists are now reckoning that the UN 1.5 degrees target might just as well be 2.5 or 3 degrees as a minimum.\u00a0 We\u2019re at 1.1 degrees already and we\u2019re still talking lots and acting just a little.\u00a0 Who knows,\u00a0 perhaps COP55 may be the one that finally gets some decisions over the line\u2026Sea levels are rising too, of course \u2013 great news for those with coastal properties set a little further back from weakening cliffs with increasing storm intensity, but not so good for the 500 million folk living on the coast currently\u2026and as for those on low lying remote coastal islands. Ouch.\u00a0 It would also appear that annual cricket match on Bramble Bank played at low spring tide by the Cowes and Lymington yacht clubs may well be Quoits on the boat deck soon enough.Covering 70% of the world\u2019s surface, knowing ever more about this warming and rising medium might well be advisable. The ocean is the lifeblood of Earth, driving weather, regulating temperature, and ultimately supporting all living organisms. Throughout history, the ocean has been a vital source of sustenance, transport, commerce, growth, and inspiration. It\u2019s kind of a big deal\u2026 Yet for all of our reliance on the oceans, more than eighty percent of this vast, underwater realm remains unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. We still know more about the moon than we do our depths.But what do we know so far and when did people start studying the oceans?Oceanography is a relatively young field of science, beginning with the H.M.S. Challenger Expedition (1872-1876), the first voyage to comprehensively collect data related to ocean temperatures, chemistry, currents, marine life, and seafloor geology.\u00a0 It is an area more of our pupils at LWC are starting to look at for degrees and more broadly, roles within the green sector. Whisper it quietly, but the future is green\u2026or should that be blue?NOAA\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and research is leading efforts to explore the ocean by supporting expeditions to investigate and document its unknown and little-known regions. These expeditions are led by scientist/explorers equipped with the latest exploration tools. Much remains to be learned from exploring the mysteries of the deep, though we might leave The Meg and Nessy hunting for another day. Watching Waterworld, Nemo or Titanic doesn\u2019t count either.That said, given the high degree of difficulty and cost in exploring our oceans using\u00a0underwater vehicles, researchers have long relied on technologies such as sonar to generate maps of the seafloor. Currently, less than ten percent of the global ocean is mapped using modern technology. \u00a0It was much cheaper with lead weights held from boats on lines back in the day, although not quite as effective.Over the summer, many of us will have been transfixed by the evolving and subsequently tragic news of the Titan submersible, which most likely imploded whilst heading towards and being relatively close to The Titanic, lying some 3800m below the Western edge of the North Atlantic Ocean, bathed in the icy cold waters melting from Western Greenland.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Titan, operated by the U.S. based company OceanGate Expeditions had been missing since it lost contact with its surface support ship about an hour and 45 minutes into what should have been a two-hour dive to the world\u2019s most famous shipwreck.State of the art sonar was used over several days and five major fragments of the\u00a022 foot Titan were located in the debris field left from its disintegration, including the vessel\u2019s tail cone and two sections of the pressure hull. That intended two-hour dive was one of many that have taken place since the Titanic wreck was discovered in 1985, a wreck site so huge that in the gloom of the deep, cameras can only ever show us tantalizing snapshots of the decaying ship \u2013 never the whole thing.The new scans from the summer of 2022 capture the Titanic wreck in its entirety revealing a complete view of this iconic boat and story. It lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 800m (2,600ft).\u00a0 Submersibles, remotely controlled by a team on board a specialist ship, spent more than 200 hours surveying the length and breadth of the wreck and took more than 700,000 images from every angle, creating an exact 3D reconstruction.The scan is made up from 700,000 images captured by submersibles (Atlantic productions / Magellan).With so much of the watery world unvisited, unknown and unmapped, it does beg the question as to what else is beyond our sight?\u00a0\u00a0 Our curiosity should be piqued for sure.\u00a0 And what about the millions of lakes that lie in our world? Lake Baikal, Russia, is the deepest (by the way) at 1642m. The bottom was nearly reached for the first time in 2008, and not a lot since\u2026Worth knowing, that none of the UK\u2019s highest peaks would get anywhere near the surface if placed there.\u00a0\u00a0 It is also at the first stages of becoming a new ocean as the region rifts apart.\u00a0 The Atlantic Ocean would have looked similar 200 million years ago.But talking of iconic stretches of water, Coniston Water is one of England\u2019s iconic landscapes, a five-mile long, 50m deep former glaciated environment, carved out by powerful rivers of ice, rivers that finally receded 10,000 years ago.\u00a0 Sat some 800m above, the old man of Coniston, often snow topped and with heather-clad lower slopes presides over this tourist-filled National Park and celebrated landscape.It is somewhat ironic that for 51 weeks of year, a 10mph boating speed limit is enforced on this exquisite stretch of water and yet just over 50 years ago, Donald Campbell took his craft, the Bluebird K7 at the then unholy speed of 300mph as he endeavoured to break his own water speed record (276mph). Only months previously he had smashed the land speed record on the dried out landscape of Lake Dumbleyung, Western Australia. Now here was a man in a hurry, with courage at his core, as well as no brake pedal on life.Donald Campbell and his Bluebird K7After a successful first attempt on 4 January 1967, Campbell turned for home (the record is judged on the average speed over the two one-mile legs in opposite directions). What took place next in front of friends, colleagues, his wife and the world at large sent shock waves around the world, as the Bluebird\u2019s nose-cone lost stability, lifted out of the water, flipped and split apart, killing Campbell instantly before sinking quickly to the depths of the glacial lake. He was just 183m from the end of the second leg of the attempt when this happened and ahead of time.Within seconds, the roar of the engine and the shattering of metal and machine was replaced with a silence and a gentle, icy winter wind softly rippling over the water as all looked on in disbelief.\u00a0 Fast forward to the turn of the century, and somewhat incredulously, as the years had passed people could not exactly place the location of this world-renowned crash site and watery grave.And what of this?5 years ago this summer, in July 2018, the Bluebird could be seen and heard once more, this time on Lake Fad, a sheltered loch on the Isle of Bute.In a world that requires us to be curious, creative, collaborative, tech-savvy and emotionally intelligent, Bill Smith, an engineer and amateur diver from Tyneside combined all of these traits (as well as a great deal of time and money) to search the 40-50m icy depths of Lake Coniston over a four year period, diving to a depth deeper than the English channel. The moment, when, in the inky darkness but for a sole flashlight, he gently rubbed away half a century of sediment from the tailpiece to reveal the British flag on the craft was spine tingling. This, after responding to a faint suggestion from the sonar that a man-made structure lay on the lake bottom. The Bluebird was found, with Campbell\u2019s body being located days later, some way from the crash site.Bill Smith, with the salvaged vessel (BBC)Smith then spent the next 15 years rebuilding this iconic craft to the exact and tiniest detail before taking her for testing in Bute in readiness for a return to Coniston and a run at speed, though not record-breaking levels, a level that today stands at 318mph \u2013 achieved by Australian Ken Warby in the Spirit of Australia in 1978.Bluebird: The Afterlife \u2013 YouTubeHis desire to make this a reality required an ability to liaise with the family, the National Park authority, the National Trust and all the volunteers whilst at all times demonstrating a deep respect for the man\u2019s final resting place and the family\u2019s conflicting wishes. Alas, a few years down the line and legal challenges of ownership are in force.But, Smith\u2019s story up until recent times encapsulates all of those traits that we aspire and endeavour to embed in our pupils at LWC to thrive in the years ahead. As time marches on, I, for one, will be paying close attention to the progress of the testing as well as keeping a weather eye on the Bluebird\u2019s return to Coniston for one more iconic run.And so, as our summer holidays took us on adventures across the UK and beyond, no doubt at some point we gazed across a slowly rising, watery and rippled landscape.\u00a0 Granted we won\u2019t always be able to don our scuba gear, snorkling mask or whip out the latest in sonar technology, but we do have the right to be curious about what lies beneath and realise that the 70% of our world\u2019s waterscapes provide us with many a future career and enhanced understanding of the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps we should dip a toe in\u2026we might even tread on Atlantis. Or even better, blow our minds and imagine what the world would look like without any water on it\u2026 Hallelujah for H2O. Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 17 May 2023 Long Sutton is a classic example of an historic settlement, steeped in the midst of time. It is a linear village, and one with a church, a manor house, a duck pond, a school and a post office at its centre. On the edge of the village and well within the parish, lies the 1200 acres of LWC.Geologists amongst you will know that millions of years ago, this region was a warm shallow tropical sea (think Caribbean \u2013 hence the chalk). Ammonites, sea urchins and sharks\u2019 teeth (all fossilised) have been found in the fields around Sheephouse Copse over the years, as well as a small meteorite\u2026The Anglo-Saxon village name can be traced back to AD979, when it was known as Suthtune (derived from Suth Tun), which means \u2018South Farm\u2019. It has gone through several iterations since. Sudtune (11th C), Launge Sutton (12th C), Longa Sutton (13th C) and Sheep Sutton (18th C), reverting back to Long Sutton in the 19th C.It originally formed part of the manor of Crondall. The village was located on the ancient trackway known as the Harroway, one of the oldest roads in England and part of the Pilgrims\u2019 Way. Although stone axe-heads, a Roman weight and a Roman coin have been found in the Long Sutton area, there is no evidence that there was a permanent settlement here before Saxon times. Of broader interest, perhaps, is the Anglo-Saxon words, which helps us decipher place names in our area.But why write this?Names are important. They guide us; they paint a picture of our history; they frame us in our landscape and they tell our geographical story. Over the years, LWC has adopted the names of the fields around the farm and attributed them to boarding houses and the like and has done the same with a small number of individuals in our history. As we head into the second century of our existence and continue to grow, there is a strong desire to adopt into our heritage the most influential women and men in our history, enhance our village / heritage feel and bring LWC to life with the addition of new places names.With that in mind, below you will find the most up-to-date map of the LWC site with the additional and changed names, along with a potted history of each of them. The names will guide our guests and help our community learn more of our history, not to mention to better understand our place in the landscape. Should you wish to learn more, do speak with Clare Faherty, our Alumni Relations Manager, to purchase a copy of Hugh Podger\u2019s brilliant book on the History of LWC 1912-2009.

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 3 May 2024 In mid-February 2024, BBC\u2019s Panorama episode, \u2018\u2019Alzheimer\u2019s: A Turning Point?\u2019\u2019 focused on the potential arrival of two new breakthrough treatments for this pernicious disease.Iecanemab and donanemab are both drugs that have been shown to slow the progression of the early stages of the illness, which 60 million people worldwide currently suffer, with 1 million in the UK \u2013 expected to rise to 1.7 million by 2024. In 2022, dementia took the lives of 66,000 people in England and Wales. It is now the leading cause of death in Britain, with Alzheimer\u2019s accounting for two-thirds of the cases. Neither drug has a licence yet \u2013 though decisions are being made soon. And as recently as April this year, thousands of UK folk will take part in two blood test trials that will help revolutionise the low diagnosis rate. It would seem that progress is being made, which could be really good news for so many.And there is also recent news that a diabetes drug may slow the progression of Parkinson\u2019s, with over 10 million people worldwide living with this disease. Ageing populations across the world, and notably in places like the UK, see these two diseases significantly impacting the lives of both the individuals and their wider families. Now more than ever, we (as parents) of children at LWC are the sandwich generation \u2013 looking after our parents and children alongside juggling our own ever-so-slightly complex and nuanced lives.But that news of those two diseases got me thinking back to a journey I made in 2015.\u201cWould all passengers seated in rows 40 to 55 please make your way through gate 4A for Malaysian Airlines flight 003.\u201d I grabbed my sandwich and my hand luggage for the trip (who needs 20kg?), striding past the HSBC advertising, which I always take photographs of for future motivational lectures but never quite get round to downloading, and boarded the plane for a 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. Three days earlier, and prior to the October half term, I was looking forward to catching up on emails, drilling holes in walls and practising my short game (these last two are not linked). But no; it took 240 seconds one evening when I bookeda flight to Australia to visit my father, who lived in the most isolated city on the planet: Perth.And so there I sat with a coffee in hand looking out on the exquisite white sands of Cottesloe beach towards the setting sun over the Indian Ocean and Rottnest Island on the horizon. Waves that had travelled 5000 miles constructively crashed onto the shores as hundreds of folk were body surfing and leaping about in the waves whilst avoiding great white sharks and riptides, neither of which are great for your health\u2026 actually without much of an ozone layer in these parts (although it is repairing), the sun isn\u2019t a perfect bedfellow either. And I\u2019ll leave the sea snakes and red-back spiders for another day\u2026That said, the real reason for my visit was to catch up with my father. Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s are never the greatest of bedfellows, but two full days of flying and (at least) a day of jet lag made for four days of touring the old haunts which lived fresh in the memory of a mind striving to hold on to the day-to-day. It was a memory that he all too vividly remembered catching a perfect wave in 1964 at the same spot I now looked at, but was a little less sure of yesterday. And with Cottesloe and Scarborough beaches, the Darling Ranges, Rockingham, South Perth and the exquisite King\u2019s Park visited, as well as the family\u2019s ancestral homes from the 1950s to 1990s, it was an emotional rollercoaster and well beyond the confines of a home in a sleepy suburb that has sprawled in this fast-growing, incredibly expensive and modern, Australasian city.And here\u2019s the thing, those four days of visiting had spanned 60 years of crystal-clear Antipodean memories before the 21 hours of flying began again. Alas, the short-term memory retention might not have been what it was, but one lived in hope that the photos, the video clips and the scribbled notes made a difference.One thing I can tell you though, the Southern Spring sun set against an azure sky felt rather good\u2026The challenge?7 days is such a long time in one\u2019s life, that I wonder what you can achieve within just 168 hours?And years later, as I reflect back on whether that journey made a difference to my now passed-away father, the photos and the smiles of the time would suggest they did, even for just a memorable minute in a decidedly unmemorable decade.Be courageous, be daring and settle for the exceptional.Amen to that for our incredible research scientists and medics who are finding ways to transform our lives for the better and take on the challenges of ageing. I have my fingers firmly crossed that many of our LWC pupils will find themselves in the medical world, too. For our nation needs medics and researchers with emotional intelligence, a restless curiosity, a deep-seated kindness and a desire to make a difference. All things they have in bucketloads.Yours,Adam Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 23 February 2024 I absolutely love finding out about new facts and beyond the joys of QI and other such programmes, I have been listening to \u2018No Such Thing As a Fish\u2019 on BBC Sounds. Comedy and Facts all rolled into one. Genius!\r\nBut the most recent question \u2013 What\u2019s the world\u2019s toughest animal? And no Googling\u2026This creature is almost unkillable \u2013 the endless bounds of space, no water for decades, radiation exposure, 6000x pressure of the atmosphere, -200 degrees centigrade \u2013 in fact, it could even cope with one degree above absolute zero\u2026 Wowsers! That is remarkable. Though\u2026 if we were playing Top Trumps, it does curl up its toes in boiling lava. Well, you can\u2019t have everything.Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the tardigrade or water bear. At 0.5mm, it\u2019s not going to be a great pet, but they have been hanging around for 600 million years, pre-dating the dinosaurs. One suspects they are here to stay, whatever we choose to do with the planet on our watch as a species.\r\nBarring nuclear vaporisation (another Top Trumps weakness), there\u2019s not much that gives these little critters a hard time, for when things get tough, they expel 95% of the water in their bodies, retract their heads and legs, and curl into a dehydrated tun for up to 100 years. Cryptobiosis for you scientists out there. I reckon with the state of the world presently, that\u2019s not a bad shout.I came across these having had my mind blown by a book on Space \u2013 \u2018The Planets\u2019 by Andrew Cohen and Brian Cox, for I discovered that Mercury, our rocky nearish neighbour perched uncomfortably next to the sun and enjoying standard daytime temperatures of 500 degrees+, had ice on it (what?!). Mercury is a place where in crater bottoms, out of the glare of the sun, temperatures are minus 180 degrees. Not even the tardigrades are getting their beach towels out in that part of the world.But my head shook even more when I read of the UAE\u2019s idea to tow icebergs from the Antarctic to The Middle East to alleviate drinking water issues, not to mention using this million-year-old ice for gin and tonics. And you thought Fever Tree was expensive! Can you imagine \u2013 Antarctic ice, the purest, cleanest and oldest ice on the planet chilling your mixer?The UAE to TOW AN ICEBERG from Antarctica to Fujairah (youtube.com)\r\nBut let us journey through the murky grey and swollen seas of the Patagonian region of Aysen (Chile), where nearly 200 years ago, seamen would lasso their iceberg cargo, and sail back to harbour to unload their frozen cargo thereby refrigerating the city\u2019s beer stocks. It makes the ice houses of Victorian Britain seem somewhat tame in comparison. We would cut winter lake ice and lay it in beds of straw, housed in sunken buildings to achieve the same effect.Even today, there are also iceberg smugglers and those legitimate companies who sell premium iceberg water to make Vodka in Chile and Beer in Canada.We are an ice age planet of course, having been so for several million years now and it was only 10,000 years ago that one-mile-high glaciers finally disappeared from anywhere north of a line drawn between Bristol and Hull. The ice age before that (500,000 years ago), saw enormous glaciers in North London. For those interested, the Thames was rediverted (it used to flow up through Chelmsford, then Colchester and out by Clacton) to its new course along the edge of the London glacier\u2026Anyone only needs to head to the most Northerly and Southerly parts of the planet to see the ice age still in existence; if you are looking for some inspiration, can I direct you to the brilliant documentary of \u2018Nordfor Sola\u2019, a story of two young men who, with only their surfboards and an adventurous spirit, lived on an isolated island off the coast of Northern Norway for nine months. It has to be seen to be believed.But the ice had other impacts too. Up until the 1920s the Swiss were bemused by the fact that large numbers of their population in the mountainous region suffered from goitres, a swelling on the hypothalamus. Turned out the glaciers had stripped all the soil (which had traces of iodine) there leaving only exposed bedrock, meaning this painful and unsightly condition became endemic as crops were deficient in this essential chemical. Even clothing was designed to hide it away, such were the levels in the population.But in 1922, after years of research, iodine was added to salt (iodized salt), thereby curing the condition almost immediately for the population.But why write all of this? Well, in the UK, February is often our coldest month, notably around the coasts. It is a quiet month too as migrations have taken many of our airborne species to the warmth of Africa or Europe. But is it a time for the earth to rest and renew. It is a time to plan for the year ahead. It is at time to walk when the woods are silent. It is time to read the brilliant Robert Frost.Stopping by Woods on a Snowy EveningWhose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village though;He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.My little horse must think it queerTo stop without a farmhouse nearBetween the woods and frozen lakeThe darkest evening of the year.He gives his harness bells a shakeTo ask if there is some mistake.The only other sound\u2019s the sweepOf easy wind and downy flake.The woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep.Kurt Hahn had it about right when he created the silent walk at Gordonstoun School around the beautiful grounds, as did the Buddhists who spent a week on a silent retreat at LWC last year. Less is nearly always more.The cold and silence are integral parts of our lives. They renew us. And if you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Wim Hof, or one of the billions of tardigrades out there happily going about their days\u2026Adam Williams\r\nHeadmaster Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 29 January 2024 I watched Interstellar over the New Year. Absolutely loved it.It\u2019s an epic sci-fi film set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine. The film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn as they search for a new home for humankind.Notwithstanding the fact that the 5th dimension appeared (my brain hurt trying to understand this) and Mathew McConaughey was a (sort of) ghost who helped his daughter save the world (spoiler alert), what stood out was the way in which humans and technology interacted. TARS, PLEX, CASE and KIPP. And all with adjustable setting levels for human emotions and language, humour etc., plus some unbelievably brilliant landscape scenes set on other planets.So, let\u2019s rewind a few millennia to the now somewhat humdrum technology of today\u2026 At the back end of 2023, Royal Mail (remember them?) launched their first permanent drone delivery postal service in The Orkneys islands; the stunning yet windswept chunk of rocks beyond John O\u2019 Groats. Regularly tempestuous seas and an uneconomic service to this remote part of the world sees this as an innovative plan, although quite what some of the most isolated sheep and cattle on the planet think of this we\u2019ll never know. And one suspects that in 2013, those working for Jezz Bezos felt the same, for it is alleged that he said to his camera crew he would give them half his fortune if they could guess his next invention. Alas, no one got near as the sci-fi-esque flying drones appeared from behind them.Ten years on, and recent data suggests that the number of packages delivered by drone increased by more than 80 percent from 2022 to 2023, reaching almost 875,000 deliveries worldwide and the million mark looks set to be topped in early 2024. Delivery drones are\r\nalready used for medicines, aid, contraception and farming seeds to many of the less affluent and least accessible parts of the world, and one can only see this exponentially increasing. Alas, weapons and general military options are also very much in evidence\r\nthese days.But we must now go back even further to nearly 100 years ago and settle down in front of The Rocket Post film in the Hebridean wilderness of the wartime 1930\u2019s, where on stormy nights, \u2018the incessant sea clashes against the unyielding shorelines of ancient rocks\r\nand where the sentinels of the Harris mountains stand resolute against a frothing and angry sky.\u2019 This is our planet at its most elemental and where the photographer, Richard Cooke described as a place \u2018where God washes out his paintbrushes.\u2019 This is also a place which\r\nrewards the adventurer, and where on good days, one might as well be in the Seychelles, the Caribbean, or on the ice-white sands of Thailand with their deep blue seas beyond. In fact, the Thai Tourist Board had their metaphorical advertising wrists slapped a few years\r\nago for doing just that.And in 2002, the Royal Mail issued a set of 10 first-class stamps of the British coastline, one of which was taken by\r\nRichard Cooks from 1000ft up in a helicopter of the iconic sands of Luskentyre. 27p\u2026 now that seems a steal\u2026 But let us return to the sabre-rattling era of the mid 1930s and meet 26-year old Gerard Zucher, a scientist born in Austria who had already received much acclaim for his work on solid-fuel rockets to be used for peaceful means. His aim was to transfer dispatches across the Channel in his rockets, but before the British Government would let him loose near Dover and towards mainland Europe, he had to prove his worth in the Outer Hebrides away from prying eyes. The location chosen was the tiny village of Huisnish across a half mile stretch of water to the barren island of Scarp, and with a capacity crowd of 100 curious, yet unconvinced islanders and a smattering of press gathered, the trials began. Some 30,000 pieces of mail were compressed into that first canister which exploded soon after take off, turning those letters into singed confetti which blew out across the water. A few survived and now command huge value for those who are interested. But the next paradigm had been set and as Hollywood moved in to tell the story, Luskentyre beach and the beautiful island of Taransay (we\u2019ll skip over the ground-breaking Castaway in 2000 which was also located there) were chosen for the film. And after one further unsuccessful trial, Zucker headed back to mainland Europe and to the political difficulties that lay ahead. Somewhere deep down in the Scottish psyche though, the ground had been laid that this part of the UK could marry up isolation with innovation.And so to 2024, to the tiny Scottish island Unst (Shetland) which has become the UK\u2019s first spaceport for vertical rocket launches. SaxaVord Spaceport has been given approval from the Civil Aviation Authority to begin orbital launches. It will be the first fully-licensed spaceport in Western Europe able to launch vertically, permitting up to 30 launches a year that will be used to take satellites and other payload into space. Scotland currently has five further proposed spaceports under development, with the Sutherland Spaceport also under construction with ambitions of launching 12 rockets into orbit per year. North Uist, Glasgow Prestwick and Spaceport Machrihanish will follow after that.It would appear that this isolated Western Coastline for the UK is ideal for such technological innovation and development, and starting out on that trail are our intrepid CANSAT pupils at LWC.THE CANSAT competition (ESA \u2013 CanSat) created by the European Space Agency is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can which our pupils design and build. CanSat is a type of rocket payload used to teach space technology. It is similar to the technology used in miniaturized satellites. No CanSat has ever left the atmosphere, nor orbited the Earth, though the competition sees real launches and data collection which is transmitted back to ground. It is quite fantastic to see our pupils embracing the world of STEAM each week. Some for sure, will have a future in this world with the space industry in the UK is estimated to be worth \u00a317.5bn and supports about 48,800 jobs at 2,200 firms presently.CanSat is just one of many such clubs where our pupils get to experience the joy, challenge and frustration of Engineering and Science. Other current events include;\u2022 A thriving Vets and Medics group\r\n\u2022 Chemists attending twilight practicals at Southampton University\r\n\u2022 The National Physics Laboratory water rocket challenge for our Juniors\r\n\u2022 Attendance at European Space Agency webinars \u2013 what is takes to become an astronaut\r\n\u2022 Pupil-led robotics club\r\n\u2022 Dissection club\r\n\u2022 Diagnosing animals and patients in problem-based learning, as well as practicing suturing\r\nskills\r\n\u2022 Plans to enter a Lego leagueAnd with the Flowers Science Centre in full operation and a future application to build the C3i centre (Art, design and Computer Science all melded together) brewing in 2024, a raft of superb Science staff and an ever-growing set of parents and Sternians involved in this sector and willing to share their expertise, the future looks exciting indeed for the next generation of scientific and technological explorers. And who knows, we may even have our first astronaut currently attending LWC\u2026and I bet they have watched Interstellar and, I hope, 2001: Space Odyssey. Fingers crossed they skipped Ad Astra.

        "content": "Admm8h  | 8 December 2022 Sqn Ldr George \u2018Johnny\u2019 Johnson MBE DFM1921 \u2013 2022, Age 101LWC 1933 \u2013 19390287 Sheephouse, School HouseIt is with great sadness that we hear of the death of one our Sternians George \u2018Johnny\u2019 Johnson.Johnny was born in Lincolnshire on 25 November 1921, the sixth and youngest child of a farm worker, his mother had passed away when Johnny was a toddler. With the help of his local schoolteacher and the Squire\u2019s wife, Johnny joined Lord Wandsworth College in 1933.Johnny wrote of his first journey to LWC, \u2018In September I left Langford, Lena (Johnny\u2019s sister) travelling with me on the bus to Newark and waving me off as I boarded the train bound for London. It was a daunting journey \u2013 exciting, but a little nerve-wracking as well for a youngster who had never travelled more than about 20 miles on a bus before. The tickets, of course, had all been paid for by the college and I was met at Kings Cross Station by a man from Lord Wandsworth, Mr Brown, who took me on the London Underground to Waterloo Station. It\u2019s tempting to think that, as an 11-year-old country bumpkin, I was totally overawed by the great metropolis and the railway that ran under the streets, but my whole upbringing to that time had made me a very pragmatic youngster. I didn\u2019t feel that I had been transported to another world, just that this was how the rest of the world lived. I think I was probably too concerned about what was happening to me to enjoy my first trip to London. At Waterloo, we met up with a group of boys who were also bound for the college and together we boarded another train for the journey out to Winchfield. School transport then ferried us all to the college at Long Sutton\u2019.During his years at LWC, Johnny was a good cross\u2013country and middle-distance runner and in his final two years he played for the school first eleven at both football and cricket. He says \u2018I thought I was pretty good at both, although an entry in the 1939 school magazine \u2013The Sower \u2013 gives an entirely different impression. \u2018Unquestionably the defence was not the rock-like structure we should have wished to see. The full-backs, Johnson, Searle and Davies (when he recovered from his accident) were not certain to clear the ball in an emergency and positional defence sometimes made dangerous gaps. In the circumstances, our goalkeepers were sometimes overworked and likely to produce a jumpy state of nerves.\u2019 I think that may be a little harsh, but the same issue of the magazine records me being second in the batting averages (23.2) and \u2018an outstanding fielder at point.\u2019Johnny also recalled a conversation between himself and his English Master Mr James (Jimmy) \u2018You know, Johnson, they say you can tell a person\u2019s character from his handwriting. Yours must be pretty awful.\u2019 I think Mr James would be discounting that theory now!Johnny was Head Prefect and left LWC in 1939. He wrote of his reflection on his time at LWC, \u2018Perhaps I took the efforts that they (LWC) made on my behalf a little for granted. Certainly, it wasn\u2019t until I was older and wiser that I understood how much Lord Wandsworth College had done for me and how good they had been to me. The military men who ran the school gave me a glimpse of life in an institution that certainly stood me in good stead when it came to serving in the RAF. Yet \u2018institution\u2019 seems too cold and harsh a word to describe Lord Wandsworth College. They cared for me and cared about me, which is something that, aside from my lovely sister, Lena, I had not experienced before. They had taken a shy and nervous little boy and helped him take the first steps towards becoming an increasingly confident young man. For that I will be forever grateful\u2019.After leaving LWC, Johnny took up a post as an Assistant Park Keeper in Basingstoke and later joining the RAF a few months after war had been declared. Johnny was the last surviving member of the legendary \u2018Dambusters\u2019 of 617 Squadron. He flew 50 missions during his 22 years\u2019 service in the RAF and was the bomb aimer on the night of 16 May 1943, as part of Operation Chastise. The operation set out to destroy three dams deep within Germany\u2019s Ruhr valley in order to set back the country\u2019s war effort, a task that was thought near impossible. It delayed production in the Ruhr quite considerably and contributed hugely to the war effort. Tragically 53 of the original 132 service men who went out on that mission lost their lives. Johnny was awarded a raft of medals including the Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in this daring 617 Squadron raid.In 2017, Johnny was awarded an MBE for services to World War Two. When collecting his award at Buckingham Palace the Queen told him she was \u201cglad to see the Dambusters are still here\u201d.Johnny visited LWC on a number of occasions, and was always very warmly welcomed, with pupils eager to hear his stories and meet a real-life hero. He always had a glint in his eye and a grace and gentleness about him. One of the more recent occasions was when Johnny kindly agreed to unveil the new LWC War Memorial at our Remembrance Service in November 2017. The BBC visited LWC to film Johnny at this poignant event and the well-known BBC journalist, Steve Humphrey, interviewed him in School House. The interview was then aired on BBC South later that day. We were delighted that he was also able to attend Foundation Day the following year, as we know that the Lord Wandsworth Foundation was close to his heart.RIP George \u2018Johnny\u2019 Johnson, you will be missed by the whole LWC Community. Our sincere condolences are with his family at this time. Back to all News",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 31 January 2022 Propelling Art A level students towards a broader skill base, ARTiculation is a nationally acclaimed public speaking competition set up by The Roche Court Trust.ARTiculation is designed to stimulate students\u2019 interest and understanding of art while developing individual thinking, observation, research and presentation skills. The Trust invites 6th Form students to give a ten minute speech based on a work of art, artefact or image of their choice. The competition has been recognised in the national media and was made the subject of the BBC\u2019s Culture Show some years ago.LWC Artists are proud to have twice achieved prizes at regional level and the winners of the regional round go forward to the National finals held at Clare College, Cambridge.This year Jess B, Upper Sixth, chose to enter this prestigious competition which was hosted virtually.Andrea Rose, OBE thanked all speakers for delivering such a fascinating presentations and applauded them for courageously having been revealing about themselves and the works of art \u2013 adding that you cannot speak about one without the other, which all speakers had beautifully demonstrated. Andrea added that all speakers had brought contemporary interests and concerns into their discussions of the works, sometimes in shocking ways, and, most importantly had shown us all, through their presentations, that the future is safe in their hands!As an additional bit of advice for all speakers going forward, Andrea Rose shared that when looking at a work of art, this should be described objectively as much as is possible. Its size, date and subject matter (which may not always be as obvious) should be taken in consideration, before presenting the audience with a subjective response.Andrea Rose praised Jess for an inventive introduction to Kandinsky and noted she had not fallen into any of the old clich\u00e9s! She added that the notations that Jess had shown were beautiful, lyrical and new to her (Andrea), and that hearing Jess play at the end of the presentation had been magical, describing it as a \u2018beautiful way to illustrate the subject you were talking about\u2019.

        "content": "Admm8h  | 4 October 2022 LWC 3rd Form pupils put their filmmaking skills to the test for the 13th year running with the One Day Film School recently.In the morning, they learned the essentials:Film History \u2013 from the early days of film to the latest in special effects.Fight Choreography \u2013 analysing James Bond/Indiana Jones fight scenes\u2026 and filming their own screen punch.Camera \u2013 learning to use an iPad like a pro, tips and tricks to avoid common mistakes, making a practice 3 Shot Film about a theft.Screenwriting \u2013 discovering 3 key things every good script needs, how to tell a great story, create memorable characters\u2026 and make us care.In the afternoon, pupils took the 10 Shot Challenge: creating a short film (2mins, max) based on a classic narrative (eg. \u2019Someone is kidnapped, an attempted rescue\u2019) for premiering at the end of the day. Pupils self-allocated a role within their film crew (writer, director, producer, screenwriter, actors).Most adverts take several months to make, so the challenge of making a successful short film in just ninety minutes can be daunting. However, the groups gelled exceptionally well, showed great leadership and teamwork, and no-one missed the deadline. Their final task was to introduce their film, just like at the Cannes film festival, and give it a poster tagline (eg. \u2018In space no-one can hear you scream\u2019). Then it was time for the VIP judges (Adam Williams, Young Film Academy representatives) to take their seats and decide which would win the ultimate prize: the Best Picture Oscar\u2026The standard was very high, so it was a tough decision\u2026 the Best Picture Oscar was awarded to \u2019 The Enchanted Blade\u2019. It told an engaging, entertaining story which was technically superb: the judges were particularly impressed by the excellent performances and high standard of camerawork, editing and sound design. Congratulations to the winning team \u2013 hope to see you at the (real) Oscars one day soon!Thank you so much to Ed and Jesse fromonedayfilmschool.comfor this really fun and inspiring day!

As a group they competed in 4 jumping classes ranging from 70/75cm up to 1/1.05m.The highlight of the trip was our 80/85cm team of Lucie C, Izzy C, Will A and Alice R, being the highest placed school in Hampshire and gaining a qualification to compete at Hickstead in May 2023 at the Inter-County Championships. In addition to qualifying as part of the team, Will A has also qualified as an individual at 90/95cm; this means he was the highest placed rider from Hampshire in this class.To qualify for the Inter-County Championships at Hickstead is a fantastic achievement. Only one school from each county can qualify in a class. This was a very competitive show which lots of other schools had entered so we are incredibly proud of our riders and their achievements.

Thanks to a successful 2022 season which saw the under 15 boys lift a trophy, the 1st XI girls reach the latter stages of a national cup (losing to the eventual winners), cricket continues to be the most popular single term sport.Over the past 18 months we have invested heavily on and off the pitch to ensure the cricket programme continues to thrive. Those recent investments include; a state of the art bowling machine, five new artificial nets, three new pavilions and the refurbishment of another, two new elite player programmes which run from September \u2013 April and a dedicated girls playing area.With an ever-increasing number of pupils part of elite programmes outside of LWC, cricket is now very much a three-term sport. As a result, an increased pre-season programme is already underway with the first of an annual domestic tour to a fellow top 100 cricketing schools beginning this April.Not looking to rest on our laurels, our vision for the future is very much in motion. Investment will continue with an emphasis placed on the structure of girls\u2019 cricket.\u2019Girls\u2019 Player of the Year 2022, Bella M said:\u2018Cricket at LWC gives me the opportunity to learn and progress different aspects of my game in a safe and respectful environment which I really enjoy. LWC gives the same possibilities to all pupils, regardless of levels and experience. You can see the investment LWC has made; new bowling machines and speed guns are examples of the professional nature of cricket here.I\u2019m part of the Elite Player Programme which has allowed me to focus on smaller details in my game as well as massively gaining confidence by working with some of the older first team boys in nets and other drills\u2019.Girls\u2019 1st XI Captain 2022, Sophie C:\u2018For me, LWC cricket not only gives me the platform to improve my own game with close interactions with coaches but gives me the chance to give advice and encouragement to less experienced players. I feel empowered as a leader. I have been given chances to train during the off seasons so I can continue improving. 1-1 sessions are particularly good as I can focus on my game a lot.All aspects of LWC cricket give me a release from everything else as well a great chance to meet other people who I wouldn\u2019t normally interact with and so form close friendships\u2019.2023\u2019s successful roll call of schools \u2013 which features both state-funded and private establishments \u2013 was finalised after an exhaustive selection process that saw a huge number submit entries for inclusion in the guide.All entries were then judged against an extensive set of criteria, which included a compelling commitment to cricket in the curriculum, facilities, fixture programmes and coaching.The Cricketer gathered entries and compiled the leading lists, consulting former England star Lydia Greenway and her coaching initiative Cricket For Girls to select the top 20 all-girls schools.The Cricketer researches and produces the Schools Guide annually, with the 2023 edition being supported by Durant Cricket \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading suppliers of cricket ground equipment.Cristian Durant, managing director of Durant Cricket, commented:\u201cWe have supported The Cricketer\u2019s sterling coverage of school\u2019s cricket, which showcases the fantastic job coaches and staff are doing for grassroots cricket, for many years.

He channelled his inner rap artist, dressed as Pirate Captain and delivered a very entertaining version of B.O.B\u2019s Magic.The judges struggled to guess who was under the masks, with inspired costumes from our brilliant textile department. In the end, the audience voted Pirate Captain Malden the winner as he was impossible to work out with his dazzling rap performance!Another fantastic LWC event \u2013 many thanks to the event organiser, Mr Andrews, for entertaining us and the tech team for all their hard work Back to all News",

        "title": "MANDARIN AT LWC",
        "content": "Admm8h  | 11 July 2022 I have absolutely loved learned Mandarin at LWC. Without having the option to learn it as a Saturday morning activity I would never have tried it, and yet it has become the main focus of my undergraduate degree and I would not have found my academic passion until a good while later in life without it. I will be eternally grateful to Mrs Zhang (\u5f20\u8001\u5e08), the Foundation and Mrs Badger for organising the activity.I have grown up with a poster of the world map up on the wall at home, because the very idea of travel really excites me. Yet my dreams had always focused on American, African or European travel because I knew next to nothing about Asia. Until I joined LWC, I had never really considered the prospect of travelling to the East when I was older, let alone learning an East Asian language like Mandarin for my degree. I had always loved Spanish and knew from an early age that I would continue it throughout life. However, I will always remember the random Sunday evening in Second Form when my Mum suggested I try the school\u2019s Mandarin club as my activity that next term. I\u2019m one of three children, and we had all been permitted to try one paid activity at the school, whether that be music lessons for an instrument or, in my case, language classes. I had agreed because I was not musically inclined and had met a girl that previous year who used to learn Chinese during her time in Singapore. Ironically, she had hated Mandarin and had been forced to learn it by her parents, but the unfamiliarity of the language intrigued me, and I decided to sign up alone at age 12, without the group security of my friends.As stated, I had never studied Mandarin before, and I really did approach the lessons as a club at the beginning. I did do the homework, because I enjoyed it, but it took me those next two terms (if not a year) to get to grips with the pinyin alphabet and Mandarin tones. I couldn\u2019t write much from memory, but I could say the odd sentence.By the end of third Form we had to choose GCSE options, and I was fortunate enough to have started Mandarin at the same time as both some beginners and some more advanced students who had lived and learned the language in Singapore for a number of years. Our group had collectively attended the same sessions, as it had worked best with our Saturday timetables, and our teacher suggested we turn the club into a GCSE class by adding lessons 6pm-7pm on a Monday and Thursday evening in addition to the Saturday mornings.I had never felt as proud as I had felt on the morning I discovered my achievement of a grade 9 in my Mandarin GCSE. I had taken the GCSE in Lower Sixth rather than alongside the rest of my GCSEs in Fifth Form, because I had been finding the balance of all those subjects quite hard and I hadn\u2019t started the subject in First Form, like I had the others. This turned out to be a great decision for me, as I felt my language ability had hugely improved throughout the summer of 2019, when I organised and experienced a Chinese homestay in Chongqing, and I had tested my knowledge before my exam by setting up beginner online Mandarin tutoring lessons on Zoom in the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 Summer Lockdown, teaching a Scottish businessman basic Mandarin from scratch and perfecting my tone pronunciation.Not every university offers Mandarin as an undergraduate degree, and I was overjoyed to discover that you don\u2019t need to have an A level to undertake the challenge. In fact, you can study a Mandarin undergraduate degree from a beginner level, pre-GCSE!I am so excited to be studying my passion for my degree, and I cannot wait to live and study at a Chinese university in Beijing for my year abroad in the third year. None of this would have been possible without help from the Foundation, Mrs Badger and Mrs Zhang, all of whom have created a fantastic opportunity for the students at this school and have genuinely changed my life for the better.Rianna Harris, outgoing Head of College and Sternian.

        "title": "MUDDY STILETTOS REVIEW 2022",
        "content": "Admm8h  | 24 February 2022 Muddy Stilettos ReviewFebruary 2022WHAT? WHERE?Look out for tractors, we\u2019re off to the country \u2013 to the pretty hamlet of Long Sutton in Northeast Hampshire. On the Surrey border and the fringes of Berkshire, Lord Wandsworth College is a selective, co-ed day, boarding and flexi-boarding senior school which welcomes pupils of all faiths. Set in a vast green 1,200 acres, it has 650 pupils aged from 11 \u2013 18 years, a 60/40 boys-to-girls split.The original Manor House has been expanded out in all directions over the years over a large campus which comprises listed buildings and shiny new blocks, keeping pupils fit as they move from boarding houses to lessons and lunch.Originally founded in 1912 as a boarding school, it was transformed in 1922 by the Baron of Wandsworth who gifted a fortune in his will to create a school for the orphaned boys of agricultural workers. \u2018Foundationers\u2019 combined lessons with working on Stern Farm, an arable, 850-acre on-site farm that\u2019s still on the site today (don\u2019t worry, today\u2019s kids aren\u2019t expected to muck in and harvest the crops \u2013 unless they desperately want to). The Foundationers were joined by fee-paying students in 1946.In 2021, Lord Wandsworth College and St Neot\u2019s prep school struck formal collaboration, geared to creating a joint educational ethos and to provide an all-through school. Other pupils join the school from the likes of Yateley Manor along with nearby Surrey and Berkshire schools like Daneshill, Edgeborough, Bishopsgate and Thornegrove.FACILITIES/SPORTSPlayed here since 1943, Lord Wandsworth has had a fearsome reputation for competitive rugby, turning out the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Ugo Moyne and Charlie Amesbury. Yet, while the current team still hold their own in interschool competitions and sport is still a real calling card, these days, pupils are more likely to claim silverware in hockey and cricket (two of the girls\u2019 cricket team also play for the Southern Vipers squad, representing the South of England).The most popular sport in the school, most pupils (80%) play hockey, both for fun and competitively. Lord Wandsworth College fields 18 boys\u2019 teams and 14 girls\u2019 teams, with links to local clubs, England Hockey Development Centres and the Hampshire Hockey Development Centre for training. Those who opt for GCSE PE tend to do pretty well, too: in 2021, over half (56%) received GCSE A \u2013 A* grades, and 93% passed at A \u2013 C. At A\u2019Level, there was a 100% A \u2013 B pass rate, with 50% achieving A \u2013 A*.Facilities-wise, there\u2019s plenty of space to play \u2013 the vast campus is surrounded by multiple, county-standard pitches for rugby, football and cricket, including new fields laid specifically for girls\u2019 cricket in 2020. Hockey is played on several large, floodlit Astro pitches and there are outdoor tennis courts, too. Making use of the woodland space, there\u2019s a mountain bike track and an area earmarked for 5k and 10k \u2018Beckwith\u2019 Runs, scheduled to open in September 2022 in conjunction with the school\u2019s Centenary. Indoors are netball courts, a 25m swimming pool, a climbing wall and a trampoline.Lord Wandsworth College also offers riding classes, in conjunction with Wellington Riding School, and has an increasingly successful equestrian team. Great fun \u2013 and good preparation for Oxbridge potentials \u2013 the school\u2019s Paddling Club trains pupils to take part in the epic 125 mile Devizes to Westminster Canoe race.FACILITIES/THE ARTSThe well-equipped Art School has had a substantial refurb. Inside, a Sixth Form studio, ceramic studio, printmaking area and specialised Art Library are made good use of by the decent numbers here who go on to take Fine Art and 3D Art as GCSE subjects (91% of whom got an A or A* in 2021).The Nadine Uppal Theatre, opened in October 2021 after a major refurb by the Room with A View actor and ex-pupil Julian Sands, is very well equipped. GCSE Drama numbers are low but growing fast and it\u2019s a hugely popular cocurricular activity: LAMDA classes (offered between Years 3 and 8) are oversubscribed.The cohort are pretty musical too \u2013 there\u2019s a concert band, regular trips to the Albert Hall, Cadogan Hall, Glyndebourne, London\u2019s West End and local venues, masterclasses, workshops and lectures delivered by professional musicians. Plenty of pupils (approx. 65%) play an instrument and take individual lessons.FACILITIES/ACADEMICLord Wandsworth College has made some pretty major updates in the last five years, from updated Humanities and English classrooms to a new Health Centre, additional girls\u2019 boarding accommodation and a shiny, light-filled dining hall extension, doubling the existing capacity.Now in final phase of a ten-year campus extension project \u2013on course to be finished in six \u2013 the school opened a huge new multi-million-pound science centre earlier this year. In it are 13 laboratories, top-spec facilities and a walled garden for outdoor experiments. Plans for future development include a new outdoor theatre, classrooms and a shepherd\u2019s hut in the woods which will host lessons in Outdoor Education as part of their ongoing \u20181200 Acre\u2019 project.SIXTH FORMLike the rest of the school, whether day or boarding (weekly, flexi or full), the Sixth Formers, numbering 175 are part of the thriving boarding house and school community, taking part in drama, sport and other activities like debating club outside of lessons. Classes average just 8 \u2013 12 students, giving plenty of scope for individual tuition, and there\u2019s time dedicated to one-to-one careers guidance with their Head of Futures.Most Sixth Formers go on to University, around half to the Russell Group, with Bath, Cardiff, Exeter, Royal Holloway all popular choices. In 2021, two leavers went to Oxbridge and four to medical schools, with a further three Oxbridge offers so far in 2022. Others have successfully landed places on degree apprenticeships at the likes of Rolls Royce and Price Waterhouse Coopers and many budding entrepreneurs have gone on to start their own businesses.ACADEMICSGood. Results have improved significantly in recent years and there\u2019s a recognition that University isn\u2019t necessarily the right path for everyone. Places are offered on the results of the ISEB Common Pre-Test, taken in Year 6, a school report and an informal interview.Sixth Formers looking for more practical paths can opt for BTECs in Sport, Creative Digital Media and Enterprise and Entrepreneurship. In 2021, 59% of pupils achieved A or A* at GCSE and 89% achieving A*- B. At A\u2019Level, 56% achieved A* \u2013 A and 94% achieved A \u2013 C.PASTORAL CAREThis is a real area of strength for Lord Wandsworth College. The school was recognised in 2019 by the Boarding Schools\u2019 Association and again in 2020 at the Independent School of the Year Awards with national awards for mental health and wellbeing. It was also shortlisted for the BSA Working with Vulnerable Children Award in recognition of the work of the Foundation.Counselling is available five days a week, 70 members of staff are qualified as Mental Health First Aiders and there are five nurses, one FEIPS- (Framework for Enhanced Individual Pastoral Support) Qualified staff member and an onsite chaplain.The school also has Wellbeing prefects and is big on programmes that enhance self-esteem, inviting external guest speakers every fortnight to discuss wellbeing topics. A parent engagement programme offers support on wellbeing topics like support with revision, online safety and inclusion and diversity.A dedicated Charity and Outreach programme also enables students to work with the wider community, including disabled youngsters and care home residents.BOARDINGThe boarding community is massive at Lord Wandsworth, outnumbering day pupils 60/40. Every student automatically becomes part of a boarding house which serves to integrate day and boarding communities. Flexi, weekly or full boarding options are all on offer with the majority (around 70%) choosing to flexi-board, despite the fact that 90% live within 40 minutes\u2019 drive and just 6% come from overseas. Three quarters of the teaching staff live onsite.Boarding houses are separate buildings spread around the campus with large kitchens and communal areas. The bedrooms I see are functional with sweeping views \u2013 but with a co-curricular programme of over 100 activities including canoeing, chess, Mandarin and music tech, you get the sense pupils don\u2019t spend a lot of time here. Aside from Saturday enrichment, weekends are quieter but there\u2019s the chance for full boarders to go off-campus for bowling, go karting, cinema and shopping trips.THE HEADHeadmaster since 2015, Adam Williams has been a real force for change at Lord Wandsworth College. He grew up on the West Coast of Australia, and after moving to the UK, was educated at Bradfield College, later graduating with a degree in Geography from Durham University.Previously Head of Geography at Bradfield School, House Master at Oakham School and senior deputy head at The Glasgow Academy, his quiet enthusiasm, refreshing Aussie openness and passion for the job have made him a real hit here.Clearly a big believer in student autonomy \u2013 in word and deed \u2013 he\u2019s consulted pupils on some hefty investment projects totalling \u00a320m and new faculty appointments over the last six years, even allowing them to approve and veto at interview stage.QUIRKSStill a cornerstone of the school, the charitable Lord Wandsworth Foundation continues to support bereaved children and those who\u2019ve lost the support of one or both parents through other circumstances such as divorce, disability or mental ill-health.Less common now in independent schools, Lord Wandsworth College\u2019s non-uniform Saturday morning programme (9.30am until 11.30am) is still going strong. Part of the school\u2019s focus on character education, weekend boarders are expected to participate, but it is optional for other students and around 80% do.The mantra is \u201call about choices\u201d and they take it to the max \u2013 here you can study for a GCSE in Astronomy and take part in everything extra-curricular activities from bike surgery, carriage driving, sailing, dissection and Greek clubs. Academic clinics, Oxbridge preparation and other academic extension programmes also take place on Saturday mornings, upskilling the pupils on everything from activism to networking and setting up a company.Kicking off the school year on a messy high, the Lord Wandsworth College Colour Run sees pupils take a two-and-a-half kilometre route around the schools grounds to raise money for charity \u2013 while enthusiastic onlookers throw armfuls of coloured powder at them. Oh, and another unusual sporting quirk \u2013 Lord Wandsworth College have a long tradition of playing \u2018Puddex\u2019, a hybrid game of cricket and rounders.ISI REPORTIn its 2020 ISI inspection, the quality of students\u2019 academic and other achievements was rated Good and the quality of students\u2019 personal development as Excellent.MOBILE PHONE POLICYLord Wandsworth College believes in the mental health benefits of having time offline. Brought in as part of a digital detox three years ago, there\u2019s a well adhered-to no mobile phone policy between 8am and 5pm on school days.TRANSPORTThe school runs a morning bus service Monday to Friday and a reduced service on some routes on Saturday mornings. The school day is officially 8.30am to 4pm but activities can run up to 8pm in the evening and all students have access to boarding house facilities, allowing flexibility on pickup times for day pupils.FEES + SCHOLARSHIPSSlightly higher or comparative with other local independents. Fees for 2022 are \u00a37,340 per term up to \u00a310,790 per term for junior school (depending on day, flexi or full boarding) and \u00a38,630 per term up to \u00a312,280 per term for senior school, or \u00a357 per night for occasional boarding.Scholarships are offered at all the main entry points (11+, 13+ and 16+). The majority are honorary (no fee discount) but a small number carry a financial reward of up to a 10% reduction in the annual fees. Disciplines include Academic, Art, Performing Arts, Sports, Design and Technology and All-Rounder Awards.WORD ON THE GROUNDDay and boarders are equally enthusiastic \u2013 one day pupil says she feels safe and included in the boarding community, loves the spirit, the food and the drama clubs, especially Thursday night Shakespeare. Another full-time boarder and Foundationer praised the Pupil Voice programme, saying new ideas are taken up quickly. She enjoys the routine of breakfasting and walking to lessons with peers, although she admits it can be quiet on the weekends. Parents say they love the fact that children are well cared for and treated as individuals although a few prospective families are mindful of the potential pressure from kids to flexi-board and deterred by it.THE MUDDY VERDICTGood for: Independent thinkers, sporty types and budding entrepreneurs will all do well here, with plenty of individual attention and a nurturing boarding community that benefits everyone.Not for: Kids who aren\u2019t so keen on co-curricular and leave bang on the bell will find themselves in a minority. Logistics-wise, the rural location doesn\u2019t make an easy pickup for all routes, especially in darker winter months. There\u2019s no pressure from the school but many day pupils do apply pester power to transition to flexi-boarding, which won\u2019t be for everyone.Dare to disagree? Be my guest! Individual tours of the school are available by appointment. Lord Wandsworth College has its next Open Evening on Wednesday 22 June 2022. Back to all News",

It is a fantastic performance venue for a truly immersive theatre experience and looked superb last night, decked in balloons and photography of many outstanding LWC performances. The theatre transformation would not have been achieved without the generosity of parents, staff and Sternians who donated to make it a reality.The marvellous Miss Reeks and her incredible team have worked night and day to deliver an outstanding evening of drama, music and dance. The audience were delighted with stunning musical recitals, magnificent drama pieces and wonderful dance routines, choreographed by Tracy Williams from the Surrey Dance Academy.NAMING OF THE THEATRENadine did not attend LWC, but she could have easily qualified as a Foundationer here as her parents divorced when she was young and then mother died when she was only 16. She had potential, she was clever, witty and brave. Nadine loved the theatre, Macbeth was her favourite play, and she adored Kiri Te Kanawa and big opera generally. She could also be a drama queen herself \u2013 no better reason for naming this wonderful theatre after her!Sadly, Nadine passed away in December 2019, just 42 years old, after battling a long illness and is missed by all who knew her, but they picture her in an upgraded suite, with a party on the roof terrace to which everyone is invited! Nadine would have wanted this new theatre to be a happy place, where performers and audiences alike revel in the joy of the performing arts.GUEST OF HONOURTalented Sternian, Julian Sands, generously gave up his time to formally open the theatre last night. He delivered a wonderful speech, thanking donors and remembering Nadine and then read an uplifting piece to the audience.During his time at LWC Julian appeared in many school and House productions. He captained the School Debating Society, as well as being a front row forward in the unbeaten First XV Rugby team and was named Young Farmer of The Year in 1976!Julian attended the Central School of Speech and Drama in London 1976 to 1979 and since then has worked constantly in Film, Theatre, Radio and Television. Best known for films (150 or so to date) including A Room With A View, The Killing Fields, Leaving Las Vegas, Boxing Helena, Oceans 13 and The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo. He is upcoming in Terrence Davies\u2019 Benediction. Notable Theatre includes playing Tony Blair in the inaugural American production of Sir David Hare\u2019s Stuff Happens and his 500 performances of A Celebration of Harold Pinter. He is currently presenting \u2018Keats, Shelley, Ghosts and Lovers\u2019. Back to all News",

The future is bright for this remarkable game (and notably the women\u2019s game), and we love being able to play a small part in that\u2026 Excitingly, we also have a remarkable wave of superb female cricketers coming through the school now at all ages, moving into a world where so many opportunities lie ahead for them in and around the game.\u201d",

This epic story is packed with a rich array of scoundrels and scallywags but through adversity Oliver triumphs, with a little help from some kind-hearted characters. With classic songs like \u2018Food Glorious Food\u2019, \u2018As Long As He Needs Me\u2019, and \u2018Where Is Love\u2019, this was a show not to be missed.After tense auditions in September 2023, a 50 strong cast of pupils from 1st Form to Upper Sixth took on the mammoth task of rehearsing for three performances to be performed at The Haymarket, Basingstoke on 24thand 25thJanuary 2024. Miss Reeks was ably supported in this process by a brilliant team; Mr Parker, Miss Tracy, Miss Bastiman, Mr Sene and Mrs Hearn. Not only did the Directors require a host of talented actors, they also needed brilliant dancers, musicians and a superb technical team to bring the whole production together! Any successful production is truly a team effort and a show\u2019s success depends on the commitment and skill of all the teams, working invisibly to help the Director bring their vision to life and to enable the actors to realise their interpretation of the play.After five demanding months of rehearsals it was finally \u2018show time\u2019. Our parents, pupils, staff and guests could not wait to see what these brilliant performers, both actors and musicians, and our talented tech crew, had in store for us! Audiences could not have been more excited, as every seat sold out within days of tickets going on sale. As our guests took their seats and the lights went down, they were not disappointed!The cast were brilliantly supported by our fantastic tech crew, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes (photos and acknowledgments in the programme below), making every moment run like clockwork. The whole show would not have been possible without our talented pupil musicians, accompanied by our awesome music staff, who created so many moments of joy throughout every performance.As the final curtain fell, delighted guests were overheard effervescing:\u201cWest End standard\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSimply incredible!\u201d\u201cA phenomenal show!\u201d\u201cSuch an amazing show and so wonderful to see so many pupils shine!\u201d\u201cWe were blown away by the production, what amazing talent and professionalism.\u201d\u201cI would like to offer personal thanks to everyone who has been involved in Oliver! 2024; all of the cast, music teachers, tech crew and staff.

        "content": "Admm8h  | 7 March 2022 We are delighted for Phoebe Harris in 3rd Form who has been selected as the South East winner in a national writing competition and will see her futuristic poem based on the safety of the public, and the need for new laws, published in a brand-new book, released today, as part of Pearson\u2019s My Twist on a Tale: Our Tomorrow writing competition.In autumn 2021, learning company Pearson empowered children and young people between the ages of 4\u201319 to put pen to paper and write their own stories and poems of the future, compiling the winning entries in a brand-new book: My Twist on a Tale: Our Tomorrow, alongside a collection of audio stories being launched today.The My Twist on a Tale: Our Tomorrow winners\u2019 book and audio stories are being launched alongside new research, released today, which suggests fluent reading skills top the list of skills that South East teachers feel will give students the best chance of accessing a wide range of careers (72%), alongside spelling, grammar and punctuation skills (55%) and adapting their writing for different audiences (50%).Scooping the award in the South East category, Phoebe\u2019s work, A Twist in the Tale, was chosen alongside 16 other fantastic stories and poems written by children across the country.Phoebe\u2019s poem is set in 2051. A young girl and her mother discuss the need for her to tie up her hair. Not one to ask why, or why she should never walk alone at night, or why there is a stash of passports in various cupboards in the house, the girl plaits her hair and goes for a run. Ending up alone in an unfamiliar place, she is approached by a knife-wielding man with a sinister smile.Running as fast as she can, the girl escapes his grasp as her plaits slip from his hand.The moral of Phoebe\u2019s story? Not every girl will or should tie their hair \u2013 and unless we change our tomorrow, and the outdated policies and laws that ensure the safety of everyone, threats against girls will continue to happen decades on from now.Phoebe said: \u2018I was delighted to be selected as a winner! Speaking out and stopping violence against women is something I have been passionate about for a very long time. I believe more people should be aware and de-normalise it. My character fails to question such attitudes, and this portrays society\u2019s indifference. I chose poetry as poems are often short and choppy, and someone\u2019s life can be changed dramatically in an instant if they suffer such abuse. Poetry seemed the best way to convey that!\u2019Over 1,200 school, sixth-form and college students entered the competition, unleashing their fortune-telling skills. 17 winning entries were picked across categories including KS1 through to KS5, and all regions in the UK. The resulting book, My Twist on a Tale: Our Tomorrow, is available to download on Pearson\u2019s website, with all budding authors receiving their very own hard copy as part of their prize. Audio versions of each story have also been made available too!Lindsay Nadin, Director of Primary at Pearson, said: \u2018Phoebe should be extremely proud of the poem she has written. Her creativity and writing skills make her a worthy winner, alongside the 16 other young authors whose stories and poems ranged from earthlings zipping around on hoverboards, to the need for new laws to keep people safe.At Pearson, we are committed to empowering schools to give their students different opportunities to excel, and develop essential skills needed for their futures. My Twist on a Tale allows us to encourage and excite young children with writing, motivating them to create work that represents their own perspectives of the world in which we live, and find joy in the written word. Everyone who submitted a story should be very proud of their creation.\u2019Deborah Maclaren, Director of Love Reading, said: \u2018Phoebe\u2019s poem is a cleverly constructed piece in which she builds conflict, and the tension ratchets as the story progresses. Its simplicity is wonderful and I was hooked from the start. The story serves as a warning, an allegory of what will occur in the future unless we make change happen; unless we twist the tale. Brilliant.\u2019The competition was supported by a range of partners including The Reading Agency, National Literacy Trust, Love Reading, Authors Aloud, Parentkind, Governor Cymru Services, Book Love, Bookmark, Gingerbread, Heady Mix and Coram Beanstalk.To find out more about Pearson\u2019s My Twist on a Tale: Our Tomorrow, and to download a copy of the book, please visitgo.pearson.com/OurTomorrowor follow us on Twitter @PearsonSchools, Facebook @PearsonUnitedKingdom and Instagram @pearsonprimaryuk Back to all News",

        "content": "Adam Williams  | 10 February 2023 Education finds itself in a pickle. Find almost any news article on this topic and it is awash with challenges. Strikes, lack of investment, PSHEE challenges, mental health issues, teachers leaving the sector in droves, a paucity of free school meals, and the threat of Labour to the independent sector. And that was just Sunday\u2019s papers\u2026Whilst I accept that this is not bedtime reading for many of you, the opening chapters of Plato\u2019s Republic are quite brilliant, and I am sure he would be commanding airtime for much of today\u2019s educational news were he around. For those who aren\u2019t up on their Classics, Plato was the eminent thinker and philosopher of his time, some 2,500 years ago in Athens. He is also believed to be the father of Western philosophy. In short, what he thought, mattered. In fact, it still does.Top 12 Contributions of Plato \u2013 Ancient History ListsFast forward a few millennia, and in 1934, Kurt Hahn left a sabre-rattling Nazi Germany to found a new school and make good his vision for education, something he felt unable to do in his home country. In one particular moment, he undertook a radio talk in which he clearly articulated the views of his educational philosophy with a brilliant synopsis of Plato\u2019s three views of education.The Ionian viewIn the 5th century BC, the Ionians had a reputation for softness and indulgence. They believed that the individual ought to be nurtured and humoured regardless of the interests of the community.The Spartan viewThis sought to neglect the individual for the benefit of the state.The Platonic viewBelieved that any nation was a slovenly guardian of its own interests if it did not do all it could to make the individual discover his / her own powers and serve the community.In other words,the Ionian view pandered to the individual and not the community.the Spartan view worshipped the scholar and athlete in exams and games but undervalued others.the Platonic view aimed to produce the all-rounder with a balance of body, mind and character.We all have individuals who inspire us, and Kurt Hahn is one of those for me. A German educator, a Jew, a man who opposed and fled the Nazis, a man who mentored the former Duke of Edinburgh (though not his comments to the press\u2026), and one whose philosophy and vision on life was around education by experienceHis vision enabled the founding of institutions immersed in character education, like our own.Outward Bound TrustDuke of Edinburgh AwardThe United World CollegesRound Square SchoolsThe Salem (means \u2018place of peace\u2019) SchoolsGordonstoun SchoolHahn set out 7 laws for his schools:Give the children opportunities for self-discoveryMake the children meet with triumph and defeatGive the children the opportunity for humilityProvide periods of silenceTrain the imaginationMakes games important, but not predominantFree the children from the enervating sense of privilegeHis motto:\u201cPlus est en vous,\u201dwhich translates as\u201cThere is more in you than you think\u201dHahn\u2019s legacy has flourished in today\u2019s world, and rising above the tittle-tattle, the disaster and newspaper headlines must be our goal. At LWC, we are aiming to stay focused on our North Star of education, for a strong and steady gaze helps us to avoid tripping up on the brambles of confusion and uncertainty that lie across the sector presently.To articulate this still further, I will use the words of one of the governors of Hahn\u2019s schools on a leaving day for Upper Sixth pupils as they headed out into the world.Face the days that lie ahead with a spirit of adventure, compassion, honesty and confidence.Brave the stormy seas that are bound to confront you, determined to sail your ship on the quiet waters that lie aheadHelp those whom you may find in trouble, and steer clear of the whirlpools of destruction which you will meet on your voyage through lifeBe not afraid of who you are, what you are, or where you are, but cling implicitly to the Truth, as taught in the religion of your followingIf you do all these things, you will be \u2018of service\u2019If you are \u2018of service\u2019 you will make others happy and you will be contentKurt Hahn helped lay down an inspirational modern vision for education, a vision that is nearly 100 years old. But our thanks must go to the philosopher and thinker, Plato, speaking from Athens many moons before. Pretty remarkable that his views on education and society are as relevant today as they were when they first put forward in a distant era. I wonder, where would you categorise LWC\u2019s approach? The Ionians, the Spartans or those of our dear friend, Plato? And I also wonder as all schools try to wrestle with the social media airwaves and starting points of difference and success in their own institutions, where would they rest their hat?Plus\u00e7achange,plusc\u2019estlam\u00eamechose\u2026 as they might say in certain parts of NW Europe.

The artwork featured on a Marvin Gaye album cover and celebrated the joy of dance in a segregated dance hall in mid 20th Century America.The adjudicator, author Olivia Laing, described Sadie\u2019s presentation as \u2018a very composed and energetic account which worked so well in introducing the artist and travelled deep into the vibrating muscularity of his work.\u2019Sarah Brown, from Articulation, thanked all speakers for an incredible afternoon, stating what a privilege it had been to hear everyone\u2019s presentations. She added that it had been a difficult decision to make, as all presentations had been of such high standard, and that all had spoken on a different range of subjects, ranging from the contemporary to the historical and the personal.She thanked Sadie for an insight into Ernie Barnes\u2019 \u2018The Sugar Shack\u2019 and \u2018for revealing to us all a world of music, movement and art, and how they all connected,\u2019 describing Sadie\u2019s presentation as incredibly insightful.For more about this highly regarded art prize:Articulation Prize England | Articulation Prize | National Gallery, London Back to all News",

During the morning our guests from St Neot\u2019s were learning about how to life in space with Noveum Museum whilst our 1st Formers were meeting R2D2 and his band of friends in our Science Centre, although I\u2019m not sure you can say a Dalek is a friend? In another one of our labs, the 2nd Form were learning to build rockets, guided by the team from Southampton University\u2019s Spaceflight Society. Huge thanks to these young men and women who are a group of super talented engineers.After a well-deserved lunch, St Neot\u2019s learnt about the difference between magic and science from Ian Dunne and DoScience. Some thought he was Albert Einstein. I may not have corrected them on this! Both our1st Formers and St Neot\u2019s pupils also spent time looking for exoplanets in Winchester Science Centre\u2019s Mobile Planetarium.Our 2nd Form, after building their rockets, had a lesson of coding for life with Winchester Science Centre. Finally, we were able to launch the rockets in the afternoon. Even with 1200 acres of space, some of the rockets landed in Dr Murtagh\u2019s garden! Was this all planned?At the end of the day, the winners of our Sci Fi Art Competition were announced. Well done to Abi Summers, Holly Skrine, Evelyn Clayton for coming 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively.Science fiction is not about getting the future right, but about creating a somewhat plausible future, plausible enough to plant seeds and inspire people to invent tomorrow\u2019s technology to solve today\u2019s problems.Maybe we might have helped plant some seeds\u2026Nick JenkinsHead of Junior Science Back to all News",

The building includes: 13 inspirational laboratories, a conference room enabling us to link with Universities for research and lectures, a faculty room where pupils and staff can work collaboratively and creatively, break out spaces for independent study and also fantastic outdoor space for hands-on experiments.Headmaster Adam Williams said:\u2018LWC has always had a strong leaning to the sciences, and this new state-of-the-art Science Centre is a testament of our desire to keep investing in a sector of education and understanding that makes a crucial difference on the global stage. Sustainable climate change, disease and health are but three of these sentinels, which our pupils continue to explore careers and livelihoods in as they seek to make a positive difference in the world.\u2019Dr Richard Thorne is delighted to lead his team in this inspiring new building and commented:\u2018The opening of the new Science Centre represents a major gear change at LWC. The 13 fully equipped labs, will enable pupils to have science lessons in specialist classrooms which facilitate hands on learning. Furthermore, under the leadership of Mr Turney, Dr Murtagh and Mr Collins, the three individual sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) have laboratories designed to their own requirements.Our Chemistry labs have two fume cupboards, which will enable experiments and demonstrations to happen in class, particularly A Level assessed practicals. Physics labs have black out blinds to permit light ray experiments to take place with ease. In addition, for the first time there is a lab dedicated to Junior Science, which will facilitate engaging lessons and activities for our 1st and 2nd Form.Furthermore, the Science Centre will be a focus for broader study and extension beyond the formal curriculum. For example, Astronomy GCSE will be taught here by Dr Haydock and it provides a suitable location for a wide range of extension activities, such as Dissection Club on Saturday mornings. The break out areas offer areas for individual study and project work, including EPQs and promote interaction and collaboration between students and staff.\u2019Many thanks go to all our staff; teaching, business, grounds and maintenance teams who have made this vision a reality. We would also like to thank Feltham Construction and West Waddy Architects for their work on this inspiring project Back to all News",

By replicating a \u2018real world\u2019 work environment, it will inspire our pupils to greater heights.",

        "content": "Admm8h  | 23 March 2023 Having joined the LWC Catering team as a Food Service Assistant in 2016, Ashley Pyle displayed a desire to broaden her horizons and moved into the role of Sandwich Maker. Not content to stop at this, Ashley \u2013 with the support of LWC and in particular Roger Cole (Head Chef) \u2013 took on a Commis Chef Level 2 apprenticeship. The monthly trips down to a college in Portsmouth, the countless hours spent perfecting her recipes and the reams of paper required to produce the tome-like folder of evidence to be externally assessed, have all been worth it.Ashley\u2019s tutor remarked that in the 24 years of her mentoring and working with apprentices, Ashley is the first ever of her students to achieve a Distinction in all four areas of assessment \u2013 wow!Last week, Ashley received her Commis Chef Level 2 Apprenticeship certificate from David James (Deputy Chief Operating Officer) and Iain Hedley (Catering Manager). It was something of a double celebration as it was also Ashley\u2019s birthday! The whole LWC community are extremely proud of her and it is all the more pleasing to see talent and desire being embraced and nurtured within LWC. Thank you to Ashley for all her commitment and hard work. Back to all News",

The team had worked late into the night putting the finishing touches together for this inaugural celebration, recognising 100 years of Lord Wandsworth College.The sun shone over our stunning 1200 acre campus and as the first competitors arrived, around 8.00 am, there was palpable excitement in the air! A fantastic mix of parents, staff, pupils and Sternians turned out in droves with 120 registered for the 10k run and over 300 for the 5k! This was topped off with over 500 walkers who opted to take a slower pace round our beautiful campus, starting at the Acorn Gates, taking in the verdant woodland, and some of our most iconic areas around the estate including Sheephouse Copse, the infamous Quercus, and Heaven and Hell. Much to our delight, most of our guests brought along their four-legged friends, giving Crufts a run for their money!The Food Village, was packed as everyone tucked into delicious bacon sandwiches, and breakfast bites from Posh Scoff Caterers and Little Reds and fuelled with some seriously good coffee, cakes and pastries from The Hobo Co and the Really Awesome Coffee Company.Our fantastic MC, Deputy Head, Alex Battison gave the guests a very warm welcome before Ben Hazell, our Head of Athletics, and Katia Lannon, one of our new Science teachers took on the challenge of the warm up session, joined on stage by Heh Mr DJ, who got the crowd limbered up!The runners set off to huge applause followed a little later by all our walkers plus all the dogs! First across the line for the 10k, in an astonishing time of 35 mins 47, was Alex Hamilton, our Head of Classics:\u201cI really enjoyed the run on Saturday. Our woods and fields looked incredible. There was a really lovely, supportive atmosphere from all the volunteers and lots of excellent performances from the pupils as I ran the course.\u201dWilliam B, in 1st Form, came first in 5k Fastest Pupil category!Our incredible staff had volunteered to marshal the course and volunteer for the myriad of jobs throughout the day.

        "title": "U16 A TEAM HAMPSHIRE COUNTY CHAMPS",
        "content": "Admm8h  | 24 January 2022 It was fantastic news for our U16 As last week as they proudly won the Hampshire County Cup!Their coach and House Parent of School House, Mr Fisher had this to say:An awesome effort by all the team to get us here this season. In many respects the hurdle of having to beat Priestlands in the semi-final, a team who had already beaten us, was a brilliant moment in the sporting career of the boys \u2013 although clearly last night was a must and by far from being a given too, it just goes to show what a great journey of dedication and achievement the boys have put in.With 12 minutes in the start of the first half, jitters, no score and slew of penalties against us for silly stuff, it certainly did not feel like a shoe in \u2013 far from it. But a well worked team try and Andrews T in the corner put us on the board. 5-0. 14 agonising minutes later, some hard defensive work and we got back down into their end again, Baidoo goes over, Meek converts. 12-0. 3 minutes from half time and Ryde strike with a thundering run under the posts and convert. 12-7, only 5 points in it. We kick off, they catch, a thumping tackle and Dallyn comes out with it to go all the way and arms spread, flies under the sticks, Meek converts again, all less than 30 seconds after they scored \u2013 that\u2019s the way to ensure you don\u2019t let your heads go down. They kick to us, Meek catches and a minute later he is on the edge putting it down for another try, 24-7 at half time.Boys are fired up and ready to put Ryde to the sword, no let up, no foot off the gas, it needs to be put to bed now. But with Meek fumbling a sure try and damaging his hand in the first 5 minutes of the new half, we are without our usual fly half as he comes off for attention. Williams S steps up to the 10 shirt and we keep them pinned in their half. Meek is back on and scores and converts the try he should have got 10 minutes ago. 31-7. 4 minutes later some hard work from the forwards, some awesome hands and Dallyn breaks through 2/3 players for a another one under the posts and we convert. 38-7.Then we get pinned back 5 metres off our try line. 8 minutes we spend defending, as one after another of giant Ryde forwards try to batter their way over, until Keeling gets a yellow. Man down for 7 minutes, 6 of which we spend in our 22, but with no try for them, Keeling is brought back on and with a team back to full strength we go over for another Dallyn finished try, converted. We finish 45-7 \u2013 Hampshire County Cup Champions!This doesn\u2019t tell the whole story of the match fully or the season for that matter. Overton\u2019s wheels are another level (and the tries he has put in for us have been extraordinary at times). The scrum decimated them, if we didn\u2019t have the 2 metre rule we\u2019d have marched them over their own try line countless times. Hands in the backs this season have been silky and sublime, fast, accurate, out the back door, under the nose, just champagne stuff at times \u2013 awesome work! And all of this through the season has been due to boys putting their bodies on the line: Meek \u2013 head (& hand last night), Andrews S \u2013 shoulder, Umbers \u2013 shoulder & knee, Fisher \u2013 hip (current), Williams S \u2013 thumb & leg, BP \u2013 thumb, Locke \u2013 name it, what didn\u2019t you damage?! (Plus a multitude of other knocks and bangs with all of the boys). It is a tough game and not only a physical one, but a mental one, the boys have tested themselves to the very limit and been rewarded with what they put on the line.So in short: Well done gents.Mr Battison and I have been proud and grateful to coach you this season and look forward to hearing and seeing your exploits over the coming 7s season and next year.Back on College grounds at 10pm by coach and it was very touching to see a group of the L6th rugby boys, who visiting Gosden House, stood at the window, both girls and boys and clap the boys back in. I think they are looking forward to playing with you next season.Parents & families \u2013 thank you too, without your support and dedication to turning up, often outnumbering the opposition spectators at away fixtures even, putting up with the countless muddy shirts, boots, socks, trips to the doc, vast quantities of food inhaled, etc. they could not have done it.Thanks must also go to Mr Rayner and team for organising lights, buses, catering, video and all the other paraphernalia that goes with scheduling 13 odd matches in a term. The team is always bigger than just the 15 guys on the field at that moment, so please do take comfort in considering the extraordinary efforts everyone has put in to ensure the U16As are County Cup Champions \u2013 and do just savour that word for a moment \u2013 Champions.Micah BHarrison BJames LMax MGeorge MTate MTed UWilliam MAlex WHarvey KAlex OBen FSam WToby ASam ANed BJake DCharlie LCasper LWilliam M Back to all News",

        "content": "Estelle Benson  | 2 February 2024 We are delighted for Z\u00f6e Wheddon, teacher of Spanish and French (who is also stepping in to the role of Head of Modern Foreign Languages in September 2024), as she launches a new book this week! This will be Zoe\u2019s second book, the first entitled \u2018Jane Austen\u2019s Best Friend: The Life and Influence of Martha Lloyd\u2019 was published by Pen & Sword in 2021.We chatted to Z\u00f6e this week about where her love of Jane Austen came from:\u2018I grew up in Basingstoke and I have always enjoyed researching local history. Out of the blue, I get curious about something, it\u2019s like being tapped on the shoulder and having someone whisper a question in my ear. This tiny, quiet thought will lodge itself in my brain and I have to follow the thread, for a small window of time, the idea will niggle at me so much that I am just too intrigued not to take action. I just have to unravel as much as I can find out about a house, a school or a person.In 2017 to mark the bi-centenary of the death of Jane Austen, Basingstoke Borough Council launched an art trail called \u2018Sitting with Jane\u2019 which included a set of 24 \u2018Book Benches\u2019 designed by local artists and dotted about all over the area in places that Jane visited. I love a project and that summer my daughter and I embarked on completing the trail. By the end I just wanted to know more about the local woman who walked where we walked. This lead to me volunteering at both Jane Austen\u2019s House and Chawton House. It was during this period that I learnt of a little mentioned but ever present woman called Martha Lloyd, it really did feel like I met someone no one had really taken the time to get to know before, and this lead to my first book \u2018Jane Austen\u2019s Best Friend\u2019.The fact that I am a teacher first drew me in to look more closely at George Austen, Jane\u2019s Father. Everyone seemed to know that he was a community cleric but very few knew that he also ran a boarding school in his home. I was intrigued to know more about this pedagogical side of his personality. I just had to know if he was like me in regard to the vocation of teaching, I wanted to investigate if or\u00a0 how his educational values might have lead to a particular nurturing of Jane Austen\u2019s talents. He was as interesting and surprising as I thought and as I searched through archival records uncovering his tracks I discovered that he truly does have his own story to tell, a real \u2018zero to hero\u2019 arc. This scholarly and visionary educator had me hooked and inspired.There is something that I must say though, it takes courage to listen to and act on that still, small voice \u2013 if it is ignored for too long it passes on and the opportunity for all that growth, knowledge and fun is lost. The other point is that no matter how much I am enjoying the journey, there are days when I don\u2019t \u2018feel it\u2019 and that\u2019s when perseverance and determination come in. Sacrifices have to be made and I just have to sit in that chair and go to it. Inspiration does find me but only if I am there putting in the work. I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to tell George\u2019s story and it was that which kept me motivated, well that and the marvels of discovering that I had so much in common with a person who lived so very long ago in the places where we tread.\u2019\u2018Jane Austen, Daddy\u2019s Girl: The Life and Influence of The Revd George Austen\u2019 is a poignant and pertinent examination of a relationship which became the cornerstone of Jane\u2019s life, the bedrock of family and faith as she knew them.This epic journey through the life and times of the Reverend George Austen will lead you from his early childhood and humble beginnings as an orphan, through his schooldays and on to Oxford University, and beyond. Follow his career in the Church of England and as\r\nmaster of his own boarding school, as well as peek into his marriage and home life.\r\n.\r\nDovetailed in with this revealing biography is a thorough interpretation of fatherhood as a theme, as outlined in Jane\u2019s novels, with scrutiny\r\nof the fathers of all her most beloved fictional families. Chapter by chapter we will understand more about Jane\u2019s own view on fatherhood\r\nand how the Reverend Austen, as her father, coloured and created that view.As we draw George and Jane\u2019s relationship closer to us, we understand anew the many layers of clever meaning that Jane Austen\r\ninterlaced within her stories. Through an examination of this unique father-daughter bond, Jane Austen fans everywhere can pull up a\r\nfootstool in George\u2019s library and become further united in spirit with their beloved novelist.Z\u00f6e\u2019s latest novel is now available from:Pen and Sword BooksAmazonWaterstonesReaders can get in touch with Z\u00f6e at: www.zoewheddon.co.uk and follow her on Twitter: @ZoeWheddon, Instagram: @zoe_wheddonand Facebook: @Zoe Wheddon Back to all News",

Since then, the game has flourished at LWC and, although we are proud of our heritage and of players we have helped to produce \u2013 including Jonny Wilkinson, Ugo Monye, Peter Richards and Charlie Amesbury \u2013 we are very much concerned with developing a player\u2019s enjoyment for playing the game no matter what their level.",

If every player from the 1st XV to the U12 Bs can do these things, they can all participate, playing together as a team and putting the team ethos first. Finally, we see Rugby as an ideal platform to develop the character of our pupils. A rugby pitch is a classroom without a roof. We can put out 13 teams and play fixtures ranging from traditional derbies with PGS and Pangbourne to teams further afield such as Dauntsey\u2019s and St Georges Weybridge. LWC enter the NatWest Cup competitions and Rosslyn Park 7s tournaments at U18, U16 and U13 levels. Previous tours have visited Amsterdam, South Africa, Namibia, Argentina and Australia. Junior teams also have the opportunity to tour with an annual U13 Tour to Hereford which has been a massive success over the last three years. We have an experienced coaching staff, which includes four staff who have coached public school 1st XVs. The Head of rugby\u00a0is an RFU coach educator and\u00a0one\u00a0of the \u00a01st XV coaches have played at a professional level, achieving national honours. LWC hosts RFU Level 1 and 2 coaching courses. The College regularly hosts ELRA courses, helping to develop referees. Pupils also have the chance to attend refereeing courses and participate in coaching courses led by the head of rugby and the RFU. LWC respects the values of rugby, respects the spirit of rugby and respects that there is more to be taken from the game than seeking to win. It is an opportunity for our pupils to be challenged and learn about themselves, have fun and achieve. In many ways it is a game at one with the ethos of LWC.",
